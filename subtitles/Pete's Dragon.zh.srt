00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,450
一场冒险
An adventure?

41
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,970
你不知道冒险什么意思吗
You don't know what an adventure is?

42

我们现在就在冒险
What we're on right now.

在荒郊野外
Out here in the wild,

方圆百里一个人都没有...
not another soul in sight for hundreds of miles...

45
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,660
只有星星在指引我们

00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,710
冒险很可怕吗
Is it scary?

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,420
那是关于冒险的另一面
That's the other thing about adventures.

48
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,260
你得勇敢一点
You gotta be brave.

Go North with the wind where the three rivers meet

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,360
# 在树林之中 有一块空地 #
There's a clearing of sorts in the circle of trees

进入这片森林...
going into these woods...

62
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,670
就一直有米尔黑文之龙的传说流传出来
there have been stories about the Millhaven dragon.

63
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,920
那首歌怎么唱的来着
How does that song go again?

64
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,350
他们来自北方 对吧
They come from the North, right?

65
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,880
在高高的山上
Way up there in the mountains

但有时候
But sometimes,

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,640
龙也会迷路
a dragon gets lost from its family...

69
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,820
飞到离家很远很远的地方
and winds up very, very far from home.

70
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,570
传说 它住在这片森林里
They say it lives in these very woods.

71
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,190
夜里你能听到它的咆哮
That you can hear its roar at night.

72
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,150
左一个传言 右一个谣言 但据我所知...
They say this, they say that, but, as far as I know...

73
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,320
没有人真正见过这只龙
not one soul has ever actually seen this dragon.

74
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,950
除了我
Except me.

75
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,590
你见过一只龙
You saw a dragon?

76
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,000
没错
I sure did.

77
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,420
千真万确
I sure did.

78
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,210
它长什么样
What'd it look like?

79
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,430
绿色的
Well, it was green.

80
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,100
浑身都是绿色
Green all over.

81
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,130
除了他的眼睛
Except for his eyes.

82
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,770
他的眼睛是红的 就像地狱之火
His eyes were red. Like hellfire.

83
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,180
我都来不及眨眼...
Before I could even blink...

84
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,770
它就抬起头 张开它有力的下颚...
it rears back its head, opens its mighty jaw...

85
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
然后喷火...
and shoots out...

86
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,780
于是我当机立断
So, I wasn't gonna waste my breath.

87
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,020
翻滚到一旁 跌跌撞撞地站起来...
I rolled out the way, scrambled to my feet...

88
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,670
准备迎接一场战斗
ready for the fight that was gonna come.

89
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,200
但当我举起来复枪...
But as I raised my rifle...

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,030
那只龙用它的爪子向我扑来
the dragon comes at me with one swipe of its claw...

91
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,590
把枪从我的手里打飞
knocks the gun right out of my hands.

92
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
怎么办
Now, what?

93
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,390
情况不太妙啊
Things are really not looking good here.

94
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,200
但我还没有完蛋 还不是时候
But I wasn't gonna be done. Not yet.

95
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,880
我拿出我的小折刀...
I just took out my pocket knife...

96
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,540
一旦龙动我一下...
And as the dragon set upon me...

97
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
就送他回家
I drove it home.

98
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,560
又在唬小孩了 爸爸
Scaring the kids again, Dad?

99
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,800
不不不 我只是在帮助他们...
No, no, no. I was just giving them a leg up...

100
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,600
了解那片森林里有什么
on what's out there in those woods.

101
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,980
我每天都去那片森林
Well, I'm out in those woods every day...

102
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,650
我见过熊和山猫
and while I have seen bears and bobcats...

103
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,810
以及你们能想到的各种鸟类
and just about every type of bird you can imagine.

104
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
从没见过龙
I have never seen a dragon.

105
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,380
你没见过
Just because you don't see something,

106
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,580
不代表没有
doesn't mean it's not there.

107
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,660
你说那是真的
And just because you say it's true,

108
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,910
不代表就是真的
doesn't mean it is.

109
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,750
可是 我现在就要过去
But, I'm headed out there right now.

110
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,550
回头告诉你们 我有没有看见
I'll let you all know if I see anything

111
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,090
巨大的 绿色的 喷火的东西
big and green and breathing fire.

112
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,600
米查姆先生 我相信你
Mr. Meacham, I believe you.

113
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,260
很高兴你相信我 看看我的女儿...
Well, I'm glad you do. See, my daughter...

114
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,220
她见多识广
she knows a thing or two

115
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,590
但只了解她见过的东西
but only if it's staring at her in the face.

116
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,090
如果你的生活
If you go through life

117
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,860
只经历一些眼前的事情...
only seeing what's right in front of you...

118
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,470
你就会错过很多
you're gonna miss out on a whole lot.

119
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,270
看 在这一点上 你们已经有优势了
See, and that's where you guys have the upper hand.

120
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,450
记住我的话...
Because mark my words...

121
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,660
龙还在森林里
that dragon is still out there.

122
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,160
如果你们去了那片森林
And if you were to go out there to those woods...

123
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,150
去到没人去的地方...
where no one ever goes...

124
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,670
就能找到他
then you might find him.

125
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,490
除非 他先找到你
Unless, he found you first.

126
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
抓住你了
Gotcha!

127
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,360
嘿 埃利奥特
Hey, Elliot!

128
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,770

What was that for?

129
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
快来 埃利奥特

再高点
Higher!

134
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,180
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

135
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,150
这边吗
This way?

136
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,970
我们离家很远了
We're pretty far from home.

137
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,950
你在这啊
There you are.

138
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,570
没人会把你砍倒了
No one's gonna cut you down now.

139
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,960
你要走了吗 格蕾丝
You ready to go, Grace?

140
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,650
没错
Yeah.

141
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,270
再等一会儿
Just a second.

142
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,870
拜托 格蕾丝 别再这样
Come on, Grace. Not again.

143
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,330
我就是报复一下
I'm just settling a score.

144
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,240
一次为了杰克 一次为了自己 对吧
One for Jack. One for you, huh?

145
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,500
没错 差不多吧
Yeah. Something like that.

146
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,510
你们两个不是结婚了吗
Aren't you two supposed to be getting hitched?

147
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,880
没错 就是让他保持警惕而已
Yep! Just keeping him on his toes.

148
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,650

Look.

149
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,200

然后...
And then...

153
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,670
他们下降 下降 下降
Then they go down, and down, and down!

154
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,180
然后...
And then...

155
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,150
我想知道那位女士从哪来
I wonder where that lady came from.

156
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,820
别担心
Don't worry.

157
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,700
我不会让她伤害你
I won't let her hurt you.

树倒啦
Timber!

161

嘿 嘉文
Hey, Gavin.

162
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,140
都砍到森林深处了 杰克没意见吗
Did Jack give the okay to cut this deep?

163
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,680
别管杰克 继续砍
Don't worry about Jack. Just keep cutting.

164
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,740
谁同意的砍这里的树的
Who said it was okay to be here?

165
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,040
我只是按他们说的做
I just go where they tell me.

166
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,360
杰克去哪了
Where's Jack?

167
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,690
他在那
There he is!

168
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,940
这也太出格了 杰克
This is so out of line, Jack.

169
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,300
你们不该砍到这深处附近的
You're not supposed to be cutting anywhere near this deep.

170
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,380
我对此一无所知
I didn't know anything about this either.

171
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,500
这不是我下的命令 格蕾丝
This wasn't my call, Grace.

172
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,830
那是谁的命令
Then, whose was it?

173
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,050
怪不得
Of course.

174
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,430
让我来处理 好吗
Let me handle this, please?

175
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,300
问题是 你不会处理的
You don't handle it. That's the problem.

176
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,010
你说得对 嘉文个性如此
You're right, and Gavin is Gavin.

177
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,130
他是我的兄弟
He's my brother.

178
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,180
嘿 我要去学校了
Hey, I have to get to school.

179
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,190
你能在卡车里等吗 亲爱的
Could you wait in the truck, sweetheart?

180
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
我们一会儿就好
We'll just be a minute.

181
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,990
我们来看看地图
Let's go through the maps.

182
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,050
再看一遍
Let's review them.

183
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
你好
Hello?

184
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,060
等等
Wait!

185
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,210
你在哪
Where are you?

186
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,880
你怎么上去的
How'd you get up there?

187
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,850
拜托 慢一点
Come on! Slow down.

188
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,720
你真会爬树
You're pretty good at this.

189
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,410
救命
Help!

190
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,640
别放手
Don't let go!

191
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,690
不
No!

192
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,610
别碰
Don't!

193
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,030
我受伤了
I'm hurt!

194
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,550
你几岁了
How old are you?

195
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,130
五岁
Five?

196
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,340
那你可长得真高
You're pretty big to be a five-year-old.

197
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,630
你叫什么
What's your name?

198
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
彼得
Pete.

199
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,810
彼得
Pete.

200
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,680
看来你确实叫彼得
You look like a Pete.

201
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,290
- 我叫娜塔莉 - 娜塔莉
- My name's Natalie. - Natalie!

202
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,490
- 爸爸 - 娜塔莉
- Daddy! - Natalie!

203
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,650
爸爸
Daddy!

204
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,540
你在想什么 你不能这么跑出来
What were you thinking? You can't run away like that.

205
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,660
你怎么了
What happened to you?

206
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,240
我从树上摔下来了
I fell out of a tree.

207
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,730
你从树上摔下来了
You fell out of a tree?

208
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,110
你在树上干嘛
What were you doing in a tree?

209
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,120
跟着他
Following him.

210
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,040
他叫彼得
His name is Pete.

211
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,620
嘿
Hey.

212
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,310
彼得 是你的名字吗
Pete? Is that your name?

213
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,510
彼得
Pete?

214
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,810
等等
Wait, wait, wait!

215
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,850
你来自哪里
Where'd you come from?

216
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,610
你的父母去哪了
Do you know where your parents are?

217
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,890
你的家人呢
Your family?

218
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
嘿
Hey.

219
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,620
你从哪得到那个的
Where'd you get that?

220
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,590
等等
Wait!

221
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,740
- 埃利奥特 - 彼得
- Elliot! - Pete!

222
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,510
这里 小家伙
Whoa, there, little buddy.

223
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,010
你要去哪啊 这么...
Where are you going so...

224
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
嘿 孩子 回来
Hey, kid! Come back here.

225
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
过来 孩子
Come on, kid!

226
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,770
小心 嘉文
Careful, Gavin!

227
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
没关系
Doesn't matter.

228
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,330
警长 游骑兵 所有人
The sheriff, the rangers, everybody else

229
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,540
都会封闭这个地方...
are gonna be locking this site down...

230
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,970
直到找出这个孩子从哪来的
until they figure out where that kid came from.

231
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,400
嘿 你听到了吗
Hey, you hear that?

232
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,230
别转移话题 嘉文
Don't change the subject, Gavin.

233
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,520
每一次 我想采取一些主动...
Every time I try and take some initiative...

234
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,080
你就让我闭嘴
you shut me down.

235
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,070
如果我们没有砍到这里...
If we hadn't been cutting out here...

236
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,340
就不能及时发现这个孩子
we never would've found that kid in the first place.

237
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,260
我们在这做好事 杰克
We're doing good work here, Jack.

238
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,690
我们需要一批好木材 才有竞争力
And we need a big score to help us compete.

239
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,860
那几年之后...
What about a few years from now...

240
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,240
因为你提前动工
when we have nothing left to cut down

241
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,580
我们无树可砍怎么办
because you keep jumping the gun?

242
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,110
- 你要去哪 - 你觉得呢
- Where are you going? - Where do you think?

243
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,310
你不是唯一一个我操心的家人
You're not the only family I gotta worry about.

244
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,310
让我知道彼得的情况 好吗
Let me know how Pete's doing, will ya?

245
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,610
怎么了 嘉文 杰克训了你一顿吗
What's wrong, Gavin? Jack giving you a hard time?

246
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,910
你知道杰克这个人
Oh, you know Jack.

247
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,540
因为被女朋友骂了一顿 他很恼火
He's just sore because his girlfriend's stepping on his toes.

248
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,630
那是个红头发美妞啊 伙计
Redheads, man.

249
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,300
- 小心 - 小心
- Look out! - Look out!

250
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,150
那是什么
What was that?

251
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,860
我们去打猎
Let's go hunting.

252
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
彼得
Pete.

253
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,420
该醒醒了 彼得
Time to wake up, Pete.

254
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,450
妈妈
Momma?

255
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,390
埃利奥特
Elliot?

256
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,700
他怎么样了
How's he doing?

257
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,430
总而言之 很好
Pretty well, all things considered.

258
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,170
没有营养不良或者严重的暴露迹象
No signs of malnourishment or serious exposure.

259
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,940
头部应该有撞击 但...
He might have a bump to the head, but...

260
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,260
- 幸运的孩子 - 非常幸运
- Lucky kid. - Super lucky.

261
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,760
他怎么会在那里
How'd he get out there?

262
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,970
他可能曾在那野餐或者野营
My guess, he was on a picnic or a camping trip.

263
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,410
和他家人走散了
He wandered off from his family,

264
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
迷路了
got himself lost.

265
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,490
当然 但什么时候
Sure, but when?

266
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,740
看起来他在外面
It looks like he's been out there

267
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,160
待了不知道多久
for who knows how long.

268
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,580
他有这个
And he had this.

269
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,910
你确定是你的吗
You sure that's yours?

270
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,070
非常确定
Pretty sure.

271
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,780
我们来了 都打理好了
Here we are. All fixed up.

272
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,160
过来 感觉如何
Hey, there. How you feeling?

273
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,340
就是擦伤而已 彼得在哪
It was just a scrape. Where's Pete?

274
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,050
我要带娜塔莉回家
I'm gonna take Natalie home,

275
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,340
然后再回森林
then head back out to the forest.

276
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,960
也许那里有...
Maybe there's something out there...

277
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,130
一些线索之类的
some clue, or something.

278
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,840
他醒了能叫我吗
Could you call me when he wakes up?

279
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,430
当然
Of course.

280
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,890
当他醒了
When he wakes up,

281
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,970
我认为最好一切都慢慢来
I think it would be best to take things slowly.

282
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,600
一步一步来 让他知道自己安全
One step at a time. Let him know he's safe.

283
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,110
我们不知道他经历了什么
We don't know what he's been through.

284
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,690
我们给社会服务部门打了电话
We put in a call in to Social Services.

285
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,860
他们知道怎么处理这种事
They'll know exactly how to handle this.

286
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,950
目前 这里会照顾好他
For the time being, he'll be just fine right here.

287
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,990
其实 他不见了
Actually, he's gone.

288
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,210
- 谁不见了 亲爱的 - 彼得
- Who's gone, sweetheart? - Pete.

289
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,050
埃利奥特
Elliot!

290
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,480
# 没人知道如何说再见 #
Nobody knows how to say goodbye

291
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,190

00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,440

# 没人知道如何说再见 #
Nobody knows how to say goodbye

295
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,830
- 天哪 - 梅西 闭嘴
- Oh, my goodness! - Macy, stop!

296
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,550
别对着狗吼
Don't you bark at our dog!

297
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,380
# 穿过黑夜 来到黎明 #
Through the darkness to the dawn

298
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,730
孩子 停下
Kid, stop!

299
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,900
等等
Wait, wait!

300
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,220
该死 站在那别动
Damn it! Stop right there.

301
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,530
我找到他了 他在路口 就在主路和...
I've got him. He's on the corner of Main and...

302
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,440

He was on the corner of...

303
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,360
我跟丢了
I've lost him.

304
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,780
嘿 看啊
Hey, look.

# 爱是深沉的 #

00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,310
# 路是漫长的 #
This road is long

307
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,450
# 我坚持不停地跑 #
It moves my feet to carry on

308
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:40,290
# 当你走失 我很伤心 #
Beats my heart When you are gone

309
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,740
# 爱是深沉的 路是漫长的 #
Love is deep, This road is long

310
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,330
嘿 坐下
Hey, sit down!

311
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,170
帅呆了
Awesome!

312
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,340
# 没人知道故事如何结束 #
Nobody knows how the story ends

313
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,970
# 没人知道故事如何结束 #
Nobody knows how the story ends

314
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
彼得
Pete!

315
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,800
没事的
It's okay.

316
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,770
没事的
It's okay.

317
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,640
我们不会伤害你
We're not gonna hurt you.

318
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,940
我保证 好吗
I promise. All right?

319
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,200
过来
Come here.

320
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,360
静下来 静下来
Hold on. Hold on.

321
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,650
没事的 静下来 静下来
It's okay. Hold on. Hold on.

322
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,650
深呼吸 深呼吸 深呼吸
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

嘿 伙计们 过来看看
Hey, guys! Come check this out.

324
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,530
嘿

一天都不到
Not even a day old.

327
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,540
你怎么看
What do you think?

328
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,170
一头熊
A bear?

329
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,720
你们见过这么大的熊
You ever seen a bear that big?

330
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,350
我见过一次
Thought I did once.

331
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,050
明显是博比的姐姐
Turns out it was just Bobby's sister.

332
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,410
好吧 让我抓点兔子
All right, let's catch me some rabbits.

333
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,690
今晚我会带他回家
I'll bring him home tonight.

334
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,600
好的 非常感谢 警长
Okay, thank you so much, Sheriff.

335
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,770
- 你自己小心 - 谢谢

336
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,020

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,350

339
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,100
嘿 彼得
Hey, Pete.

340
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,160
别担心 你不用回医院了
Don't worry, you don't have to go back to the hospital.

341
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,780
我们去我家
We're going to my house.

342
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,430
今天阳光灿烂
Plenty of sunshine through today,

343
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,450
有季节性的...
with seasonal...

344
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,420
# 我曾常以为自己是流浪男孩 #
I used to think I was some kind of gypsy boy

345
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,510
# 在我让你带我回家之前 #
Before I let you take me home

346
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,520
# 再见 玛丽安 #
Now so long, Marianne

347
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,560
# 是时候我们开始再次 #
It's time that we began

348
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,370
# 对所有的一切  #
To laugh and cry and cry

349
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,820
# 大笑 痛哭 痛哭 大笑 #
And laugh about it all again

350
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,790
好了 我们到了
Okay. Here we are.

351
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,880
需要帮助吗
Need a little help?

352
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,630
- 彼得 不 等等 - 等等
- Pete, no! Wait! - Wait!

353
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,020
等等 等等
Wait! Wait, wait.

354
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,190
你跑得真快
You are fast.

355
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,190
天哪
Oh, my goodness.

356
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,890
怎么了 亲爱的
What's wrong, honey?

357
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,720
你饿了吗
Are you hungry?

358
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,360
我们进去吧 吃点东西
Let's go inside. Let's go get something to eat.

359
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,360
我想回家
I want to go home.

360
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
我知道
I know.

361
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,320
你家在哪 能告诉我吗
Where is your home? Can you tell me?

362
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,880
这样吧
How about this?

363
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,210
如果你现在和我进去
If you come inside with me now,

364
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,910
那明天...
then tomorrow...

365
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,550
我就带你回森林
I'll take you back out to the woods

366
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,750
你就能告诉我 你住在哪
and you can show me exactly where you live.

367
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,560
怎么样
How does that sound?

368
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,010
当我还是个小女孩时
You know, when I was a little girl...

369
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,230
我特别想住在森林里
I wanted to live in the forest more than anything.

370
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,100
我喜欢待在外面
I loved being out there.

371
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,690
和松鼠啊 小鸟啊
It was so fun with the squirrels

372
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,350
树啊待在一起 太有趣了
and the birds and the trees.

373
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,610
所以 当我长大了...
So, when I grew up...

374
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,250
就把这作为我的工作 保护森林
I made it my job to protect the woods

375
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,250
和里面的一切
and everything in them.

376
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,090
可能还包括你
Which I suppose includes you.

377
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,420
和埃利奥特吗
And Elliot?

378
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,750
埃利奥特是谁
Who's Elliot?

379
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,890
格蕾丝
Grace?

380
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,950
你确定要留他吗
Are you sure about this?

381
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,320
找到他的家就好了
It's just until we found out where he belongs.

382
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,650
谁知道呢
Who knows?

383
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,560
也许和他同龄的人能让他敞开心扉
Maybe being around someone his own age will help him open up.

384
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,560
也许能说出他从哪来的
Maybe he'll tell us where he came from.

385
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,950
你别碰它 要吃它
You don't touch it. You eat it.

386
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,280
像这样
Like this.

387
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,070
我得承认...
I gotta admit...

388
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,160
住在森林里 特立独行...
living out in the woods, doing things his own way...

389
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,460
听起来像是男版的你啊
sounds like a boy after your own heart.

390
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,180
我们可能迷路了
I think we're lost.

391
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,420
嘉文知道他在做什么
Ah, Gavin knows what he's doing.

392
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,310
你三英里前就这么说
You said that three miles ago.

393
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,690
拐弯后 河就向上了
The river's up around that bend.

394
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
我们跟着走就行了
We can just follow that,

395
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,750
就能返回起点
and we'll be back where we started.

396
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,610
那样河就向下了
The river's back that way.

397
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,430
我们一直在绕圈圈
We've been going in circles.

398
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
我以前从没走过这么远
I've never been out this far before.

399
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,680
你知道我们在哪吗
Do you know where we are?

400
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,360
看看这个
Look at this.

401
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,320
到底是什么
What on Earth?

402
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,980
你得来看看
You've got to see this.

403
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,410
你觉得是那个孩子干的吗
You think that kid did all this?

404
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,090
一个孩子怎么能做成这样
What would a kid be doing this far out?

405
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,950
嘿 伙计们 看看这个
Hey, guys! Look at this.

# 梦想成真 没有损失 #
Everything to gain and nothing to lose

# 从早到晚的好日子 #

把头放在这里 挪过去...
Put your head here, scooch down...

442
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,390
这是五岁
and now you're five years old.

443
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,030
# 如果你想表现良好 就要现在开始 #
You know you got to get going If you're gonna make a showin'

我曾到过这里 在东帕德

我好久都没读过这本书了

我识字的时候 有人给了我这本书

帕特查了失踪人口档案

476
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,720
但这不是好消息
but it's not good news.

477
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,140
可怜的彼得
Poor Pete.

478
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,360
我知道
I know.

479
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,690
我刚和社会服务部门通过电话
I just got off the phone with Social Services.

480
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,990
他们明天早上会得到他的抚养权
They're gonna take custody of him tomorrow morning.

481
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,820
彼得...
Pete...

482
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,020
埃利奥特是你想象的朋友吗
is Elliot your imaginary friend?

483
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,230
什么是想象
What's imaginary?

484
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,870
就是你脑中幻想的一个人
It's where you make someone up in your head...

485
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,240
这样你就有人说话了
so that you have someone to talk to.

486
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,170
能让你不这么孤单
It keeps you from being lonely.

487
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,870
他们有意思吗
Are they funny?

488
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,660
当然了
Sure.

489
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,260
他们会飞吗
Do they fly?

490
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,760
你想让他们做什么 他们就能做什么
I guess they can do whatever you want them to.

491
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,680
所以他们才是想象出来的
That's what makes them imaginary.

492
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,260
你也是我想象的朋友吗
Are you my imaginary friend, too?

493
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,050
我是真的
I'm real.

494
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,890
埃利奥特也是真的
So is Elliot.

495
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,700
干得好 小子
Good job, buddy.

496
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,460
妈妈 外面有个怪兽
Mommy, there's a monster outside.

497
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,610
我得回到他身边
I need to get back to him.

498
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,940
我走的时候 他很害怕
He gets scared when I'm gone.

499
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,610
他看起来像只龙
He looks like a dragon.

500
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,780
什么是龙
What's a dragon?

501
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,160
那就是龙
That's a dragon.

502
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,460
有一首歌
Like the song.

503
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,670
什么歌
What song?

504
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,130
我爸爸以前喜欢唱的歌
There's a song that my dad used to sing.

505
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,290
关于龙的 还有他们住在哪
It's about dragons and where they live.

506
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,880
# 去北方 用你脚上的翅膀去北方 #
Go North, Go North With wings on your feet

507
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,010
# 乘着风去北方 那里有三条交汇的河 #
Go North with the wind Where the three rivers meet

508
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,900
# 坐在最高的树旁 #
Now plant yourself down side the tallest tree

509
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,900
# 野外的天空闪烁星座点点 #
Measure the stars shining one two and three

510
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,890
# 看看你的周围 #
Look all around you and see

511
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,700
# 森林的深处有古龙 #
Deep in the forest there dragons will be

512
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,860
# 森林的深处有古龙 #
Deep in the forest there dragons will be

513
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:17,870
什么是北方
What's North?

514
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,330
是个方向
It's a direction.

515
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,740
要怎么去那
How do you get there?

516
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,140
你可以看看地图
You could look at a map.

517
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,670
或者跟着北极星
Or you could follow the North Star.

518
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,160
如果你跟着北极星一直走到最深处
If you follow it as far as you possibly can...

519
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,050
就能看到山
you get to the mountains.

520
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,540
那里就能找到他们
And that's where you'd find them.

521
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,210
我说的是龙
The dragons, I mean.

522
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,180
嘿
Hey.

523
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,760
我很久都没听过那首歌了
I haven't heard that song in forever.

524
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,800
娜塔莉 你能让
Natalie, do you think

525
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,600
我和彼得单独谈谈吗
I could talk to Pete alone for a moment?

526
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,020
好的
Okay.

527
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,200
回头见 彼得
See you in a minute, Pete.

528
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,080
嘿 过来
Hey, come here.

529
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:07,200
是你帮我找到的 对吧
You found this for me, didn't you?

530
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,720
那些树逃跑的地方
Where the trees ran away.

531
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:18,560
我十岁生日的时候 爸爸给了我这个
My dad gave this to me on my 10th birthday...

532
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,220
这样如果我迷路了
so that if I ever got lost,

533
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,650
就知道怎么回家
I'd know how to find my way back home.

534
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,390
彼得 亲爱的...
Pete, honey...

535
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,940
你还记得怎么进入森林的吗
do you remember how you got to the woods?

536
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,410
这是很久之前的事了 对吗
It was a long time ago, wasn't it?

537
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,960
我们当时在冒险
We were on an adventure.

538
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,460
你知道...
You know...

539
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,470
我和你差不多大的时候 失去了母亲
I lost my mom when I was not much older than you.

540
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,420
我知道有多艰难
I know how hard it can be.

541
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,690
但我希望你知道 你不孤单
But I want you to know, you are not alone.

542
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
我知道
I know.

543
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,310
是吗
You do?

544
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,760
我有埃利奥特
I have Elliot.

545
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,440
你能和我多说说埃利奥特吗
Can you tell me more about Elliot?

546
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,280
他是谁
Who is he?

547
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,280
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

548
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,870
这是埃利奥特
This is Elliot?

549
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,540
他肯定是个很特别的朋友
He must be a very special friend.

550
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,850
他不喜欢人类 但他应该会喜欢你
He doesn't like most people. But I think he'd like you.

551
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,390
是吗
He would?

552
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,650
等着吧 明天
You'll see. Tomorrow.

553
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,060
明天
Tomorrow.

554
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,700
当我回家时
When I go home.

555
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,410
你会跟着我 对吗
You're coming with me, right?

556
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,150
当然
Of course.

557
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,740
你很勇敢
You're very brave.

558
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,660
你知道吗
Did you know that?

559
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,090
你是我见过最勇敢的男孩
You might be the bravest boy I've ever met.

560
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,240
- 嘉文 - 杰克
- Gavin? - Jack.

561
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,410
你怎么了
What happened to you?

562
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,770
你记得那些米查姆曾和我说的故事吗
You remember those stories that Meacham used to tell us?

563
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,230
和龙有关吗
About dragons?

564
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,830
不是他编的
He wasn't making them up.

565
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,750
我们发现了龙 还有一间树屋
We tracked it, and there was a treehouse.

566
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,000
我想开枪射它
I tried to shoot it,

567
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,890
但他把枪从我手里打飞了...
but it just ripped the gun right out of my hands...

568
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,190
还扭弯了枪 在它面前完全没用
and bent it like it was nothing.

569
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,310
嘉文 我不能因为
Gavin, I can't just head out

570
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,560
你觉得自己看见了龙
to the woods in the middle of the night...

571
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,940
大半夜的就去森林里
because you think you saw a dragon.

572
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,750
觉得我看见了 杰克 我知道自己看见了什么
Think I saw? Jack, I know what I saw.

573
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,580
没错
Yeah.

574
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,670
你不相信我
You don't believe me.

575
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,150
我告诉你 我们要做什么
I'll tell you what we'll do.

576
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,320
我们会打电话给林业部门
We'll call the Forestry,

577
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,180
告诉他们我们看见的
we tell them what you saw,

578
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,490
然后他们就会去处理的
and then they can go and deal with it.

579
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,970
好吧 我会拍到照片的
Fine. I get the picture.

580
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,760
我还指望家人呢
I thought I could count on family.

581
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,270
嘉文
Gavin.

582
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,990
别担心 明早见
Don't worry. See you in the morning.

583
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,660
"埃利奥特迷路了
"Elliot Gets Lost.

584
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,280

他的名字叫..."
His name is..."

587
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,580
没错
Yeah.

588
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,040
"他要和家人进行一场冒险

他们要在森林里野营
They are going camping in the forest.

590

埃利奥特有..."
Elliot has..."

591
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,510
等等
Wait.

592
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,710
这和我给它念的不一样
This isn't how I tell it.

593
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,190
你要我别念了吗
Would you like me to stop?

594
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,270
不
No.

595
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,280

"埃利奥特从没这么兴奋过
"Elliot has never been so excited.

当妈妈和爸爸在扎帐篷时
Elliot and his boy play,

598
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,870
埃利奥特和他的小伙伴在玩
while Mom and Dad set up the tent.

599
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,550
他就属于这里
He is right where he belongs."

600
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,070
你在找什么吗
You looking for something?

601
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,970
你吓到我了
Oh. You scared me.

602
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,480
你为什么不睡觉
Why aren't you asleep?

603
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,470
你不也没睡 一个原因吧
The same reason you're not, I suppose.

604
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,600
你应该听说了那个男孩
I guess you heard about the boy.

605
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,820
没错
I did.

606
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,360
这个小镇 流言传得很快
You know, word travels fast in this town.

607
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,720
他在森林里待了多久
How long has he been out there?

608
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,520
六年
Six years.

609
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,320
六年
Six years?

610
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,070
没人能在森林里活六年
Nobody can survive in that forest for six years.

611
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,200
至少一个人不行
At least not alone.

612
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,870
他说...
Well... He says...

613
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,750
他说他不是一个人
He says he wasn't alone.

614
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,840
他画的
He drew this?

615
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,180
他说这是森林里的一个朋友
He says it's his friend from the forest.

616
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,930
这让我想起了...
And it reminded me of...

617
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,850
我知道让你想起了什么
I know what it reminded you of.

618
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,230
那个吗
That one?

619
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,510
我几岁的时候 你画的来着
How old was I when you drew this for me?

620
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,970
也许五六岁吧
Uh, maybe five or six.

621
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,520
在你妈去世之前
Just before your mother passed away.

622
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,770
我记得 你认真听我说的每句话
I remember then, you hung on every word I ever said.

623
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,030
总是有很多疑问
You were so full of questions.

624
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:14,150
爸爸
Dad.

625
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,370
嗯
Hmm?

626
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,750
你在森林里到底看见了什么
What did you really see out there?

627
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,040
拜托 别编另一个故事
Please, don't tell me another story.

628
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
就告诉我你记得什么
Just tell me what you remember.

629
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,720
我记得什么
What I remember?

630
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,720
我记得 我当时在打猎...
What I remember is, I was out hunting...

631
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,590
阳光照下来...
and the sun was shining down...

632
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,700
风穿过森林
and wind was blowing through the trees.

633
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,430
我在想"孩子 你就属于这里"
And I remember thinking, "Boy, this is exactly where I belong."

634
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
我停在小溪旁喝水
I stopped by a creek to get a drink.

635
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,690
突然间 我发现阳光消失了
Suddenly I realize I wasn't in the sun anymore...

636
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,930
我抬头看什么挡住了天空
and I looked up to see what was blocking the sky.

637
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,910
我怎么只看见了一只龙
And what did I see but a dragon?

638
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,580
我真的看见了一只龙
I see a dragon.

639
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,080
我一辈子都没那么害怕过
I've never been so scared in my life.

640
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,290
但当我举起枪 要开枪...
But when I raised my gun to shoot...

641
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:08,080
突然有一种感觉...
suddenly there was this feeling, this...

642
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,670
就像魔法一样
It was like magic.

643
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,260
没有其他词能形容它 就是魔法
There's no other word to express it. It was magic.

644
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,810
于是我放下枪 坐在那...
So, I put my gun down and just sat there...

645
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:23,650
我们隔着小溪 坐在那彼此对视
and we sat there across the creek from each other just looking.

646
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,110
我就坐在那看着
I just sat there looking.

647
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,150
然后龙转身消失在森林里
And then the dragon turned and disappeared into the woods.

648
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,680
我记得当时想"我太幸运了"
And I remember thinking, "I am one lucky guy."

649
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,820
当然 没人相信我
Of course, nobody believed me.

650
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,200
我知道人们怎么谈论我的
I knew what people were saying about me.

651
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,320
我必须承认
I must admit, there were

652
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,080
有一段时间我在想"也许他们是对的"
times when I thought, "Maybe they're right."

653
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,830
但我想到那魔法
But then I thought about the magic.

654
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,700
它改变了我对世界的认识...
It changed the way I see the world...

655
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,830
我对树的认识 对阳光的认识...
the way I see trees, the way I see sunshine...

656
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,550
甚至对你的认识
the way, even, I see you.

657
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,040
我不会和任何东西交换
I wouldn't trade that for anything.

658
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,550
所以我不会尝试说服你 我放弃
So, I'm not gonna try to convince you. I quit that.

659
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:08,400
但也许你愿意用开放的眼光去看待
But maybe if you could just be open to looking.

660
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,980
我了解那片森林
I know those woods.

661
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,820
我对那片森林了如指掌
I know those woods like the back of my hand.

662
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,150
我不可能错过一只龙
I couldn't have missed a dragon.

663
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,500
可你错过了彼得
Well, you missed Pete.

664
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,520
彼得
Pete.

665
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,340

01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,030
他们正在搞清楚
They're trying to find out

793
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,880
他是什么 他来自哪里
what he is and where he came from.

794
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,840
为什么之前没见过他
And why they've never seen him before.

795
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,470
你在做什么
Hey, what are you doing?

796
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,840
把那些枪拿开
Get those guns out of here.

797
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,580
就像我说的 他来自森林
He came from the woods, just like I did.

798
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,050
你认真的吗
Are you serious?

799
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,100
为什么不能放我们走
Why can't they just let us go?

800
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:16,100
我们会离开 再也不见任何人
We'll go away. We'll never see anybody again.

801
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,350
就像从前一样

但我不想再也见不到你

你不知道这家伙有什么能力
You have no idea what this thing is capable of.

806
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,360
如果他醒了
If he wakes up,

807
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,130
他会毁了这个小镇 所有人都要搭进去
he could take out the whole town and everyone in it.

808
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,620
杰克 他是个怪兽
Jack, he's a monster.

809
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:37,530
这不是怪兽 只是个动物
It's not a monster. It's an animal.

810
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:39,700
而且还受伤了 很害怕
And it's hurt and it's scared.

811
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,420
格蕾丝 等等

杰克 什么情况
Jack, what's so big

825
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,630
得调动整个部队
I had to call out the cavalry?

826
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,260
你真的得进来看看
You really have to come inside and see this.

827
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,360
- 嘉文 - 让我先提醒你
- Gavin. - Let me just say one thing first here.

828
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:01,950
我兄弟给你打电话是为了...
What my brother called you about...

829
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,710
它属于我 好吗
it belongs to me, okay?

我光明正大地抓到的
I caught it fair and square.

所以 如果有人有什么意见 也该我说
So, if anyone tries to tell you any different, it's mine.

832

它属于我
It belongs to me.

833
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,000
我想看看
I wanna see!

834
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:12,900
我们为什么要站在外面
Why are we standing outside?

835
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,330
我们能进去看看嘛
Can we go in and take a look at it?

836
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:36,780
埃利奥特 你没事吧
Elliot, are you okay?

837
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,150
里面发生了什么
What's going on in there?

838
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,430

840

我和我的人才知道怎么对付它
Me and my crew are the only ones who know how to deal with it.

841
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,230
所以 一旦我们进去了 保持冷静
So, when you get in there, just stay calm.

842
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,410
别一惊一乍
Don't startle it.

843
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,270
别让人在我眼皮底下被吃了
Don't want anyone getting eaten on my watch.

844
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,340

Listen, Grace,

846

我们不在森林了 所以里面的东西...

847
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,400
你们可以坐在外面...
You can sit out here...

848
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,490
然后争论"里面有什么"
and talk about "What's in there"

849
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,570
直到双方都气得要死

杰克 你把我叫过来就为了一只龙

Sort of,

881

01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,690
亲爱的 看啊
Honey, look.

952
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,590
再也没人见过那只龙
No one ever saw that dragon again.

953
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,310
我也没讲过关于它的其他传说
And I never told another tale about it.

954
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:44,970
那天之后 也不必说了
I didn't have to. Not after that day.

955
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,400
人们四处寻找
Folks looked high and low,

956
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,570
但都徒劳无功
but it was nowhere to be found.

957
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:53,810
有人说他飞去了其他的森林
Some said he flew to another forest

958
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,730
很远很远
far, far away.

959
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:58,940
但那些只是故事
But those were just stories.

960
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:02,610
时光飞逝
Time marched on.

961
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,790
孩子长大
Children got older.

962
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:09,170
树木茁壮 故事也变长
Trees growed taller. Tales growed taller, too.

963
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:13,460
最好的故事也会结束
By and by, even the best ones come to an end.

964
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:18,930
但我知道有人 会告诉你其他事
But I know someone who would tell you otherwise.

965
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,360
有一个小男孩
There's one little boy

966
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,030
能告诉你整个故事
who could tell you the whole story.

967
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:36,150
他能告诉你 接下来发生了什么
He could even tell you what happens next.

968
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:39,870
他知道北极星是夜空中最亮的星
He knows that the North Star shines brightest of all.

969
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:43,230
他知道森林里有魔法
He knows that there's magic in the woods,

970
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,530
如果你知道在哪的话
if you know where to look for it.

971
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:49,790
他知道他的龙还在那里
He knows his dragon is still out there.

972
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:53,620
也许 如果你走运...
Maybe, if you're lucky...

973
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:55,660
同一个男孩...
that same boy...

974
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,510
我见过最勇敢的男孩...
the bravest boy I've ever met...

975
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,670
他能告诉你哪里能找到他
he could tell you where to find him.

976
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,590
# 你为自己画下蓝图 #
You had your maps drawn

977
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:18,760
# 你心中已有盘算 只为仅有的希望 #
You had other plans to hang your hopes on

978
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:23,300
# 每条路都让你绝望 怀疑自己的选择  #
Every road they led you down, Felt so wrong

979
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,550
# 所以你为自己发掘新的路 #
So you found another way

980
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,650
# 你宽阔的胸怀 #
You've got a big heart

981
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:36,850
# 让你审视整个世界 让你坚持那么久 #
The way you see the world, It got you this far

982
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:41,700
# 或许你会伤痕累累 或许会遍体鳞伤 #
You might have some bruises and a few scars

983
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:45,120
# 但你知道你终究会安然无恙 #
But you know you're gonna be okay

984
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:49,620
# 即便你恐惧害怕 #
And even though you're scared

985
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,000
# 你仍是最坚强的那个 #
You're stronger than you know

986
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,420
# 如果你迷失于没有一丝光亮的黑暗 #
If you're lost out where the lights are blinding

987
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,380
# 置身于没有一丝星光的黑夜 #
Caught and all the stars are hiding

988
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,840
# 那时 原野的呼唤会指引你回家的路 #
That's when something wild calls you home

989
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,920
# 家 #
Home

990
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,420
# 如果恐惧让你徘徊原地 #
If you face the fear that keeps you frozen

991
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:06,600
# 投身无边汪洋追逐远方 #
Chase the sky into the ocean

992
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:09,840
# 那时 原野的呼唤会指引你回家的路 #
That's when something wild calls you home

993
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:10,930
# 家 #
Home

994
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:30,150

1002
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:01,100
# 置身于没有一丝星光的黑夜 #
Caught and all the stars are hiding

1003
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:04,110
# 那时 原野的呼唤会指引你回家的路 #
That's when something wild calls you home

# 家 #
Home

1005
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:07,860

# 家 #
Home

1009
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:41,440
# 去北方 去北方 #
Go North, go North

1010
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,650
# 用你脚上的翅膀去北方 #
With wings on your feet

1011
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,780
# 乘着风去北方 #
Go North with the wind

1012
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:51,530
# 那里有三条交汇的河 #
Where the three rivers meet

1013
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,360
# 在树林之中 #
There's a clearing of sorts

1014
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:58,250
# 有一块空地 #
In the circle of trees

1015
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:03,840
# 野外的天空闪烁星座点点 #
Where the wild constellations shine One two and three

1016
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:10,250
# 看看你的周围 #
Look all around you and see

1017
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:17,170
# 森林的深处有古龙 #
Deep in the forest there dragons will be

1018
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:20,520
# 他们生于地球 #
They come from the Earth

1019
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:24,900
# 没错 他们生于石头 #
Yes, they come from the stone

1020
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,360
# 寒冷的北方 #
The icy, cold North

1021
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:30,320
# 那是他们的家 #
That's where they call home

1022
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:36,700
# 去山海交界处 #
Go where the mountain kisses the sea

1023
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:43,130
# 用该一点 比我勇敢一点 #
Better be brave, Far braver than me

1024

If a dragon should find you

1027
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:05,900
# 你应该快跑 #
You might ought to run

1028
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:11,980
# 没人经历过这样的争论 #
No one has lived through such a run-in, not one

1029
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,910
# 如果你听见了咆哮 #
So if you hear a roar

1030
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:19,000
# 天哪 快离远点 #
Goodness sake, leave them be

1031
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,320
# 你在天上找到他们 #
Up where you find them

1032
01:39:23,410 --> 01:39:26,450

Wild and free

You won't find me
