凯莉杂货店

10
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,096
凯莉小姐 待会我可以跟您谈谈吗
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?

11
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,023
要是你说的事情会给我添麻烦什么的
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me

12
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,038
就别说
in some way or another.

13
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:05,019
九点钟的弥撒结束了 姑娘们 
Nine o'clock mass is over, girls.

14
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:14,059
-给 请等一等  -谢谢
- Now. One moment, please.  - Thank you.

15
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,073
布雷迪夫人 今天早上您想要什么呢
Mrs. Brady, what would you like this morning?

16
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,015
请给我半打熏肉片
Half a dozen rashers, please.

17
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,066
就来 艾莉丝现在就拿给您
Of course. Eilis will get that for you now.

18
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,029
-轮到我了  -下一个就是你
-I was next. - And you still are.

19
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:34,025
-您要什么    -我想要点鞋油
- Yes?  - I need some shoe polish.

20
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,037
鞋油
Shoe polish?

21
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,035
那可不是周日供应的 对吧
That's not really a Sunday item now, is it?

22
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:40,083
这些顾客可都是来买东西做饭或泡茶的
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.

23
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,036
你为什么昨天不记着买呢
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?

24
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,088
你看起来昨天就得刷鞋了
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.

25
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,064
抱歉
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,003
凯莉小姐
Miss. Kelly....

27
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,072
我没忘 想说什么 有话直说
I haven't forgotten. Spit it out, whatever it is.

28
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:08,025
我要动身去美国了
I'm away to America.

29
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,095
谁的主意
Whose idea was that?

30
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:15,043
纽约的弗洛德神父安排的
Father Flood in New York arranged it.

31
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,095
露丝以前跟他打过高尔夫球 他资助我去的
Rose used to play golf with him. He sponsored me.

32
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,091
他帮我找了份工作 办好了签证
He found me a job and got me a visa.

33
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:22,063
好吧 我们今后也不需要你了
Well, we won't be needing you back here.

34
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:24,022
我走之前 每周日都可以来上班
I could work every Sunday until I go.

35
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,031
不用 谢谢你了
No, thank you.

36
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:31,015
-你可怜的姐姐   -我姐姐怎么了
- Your poor sister. - My sister?

37
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:34,055
在这个国家母亲总是被丢下 
Oh, mothers are always being left behind in this country.

38
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:39,015
可是露丝 这就是她的结局了 不是吗
But Rose ... That's the end for her now, isn't it?

39
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:42,023
下半辈子 都得由她来照顾你们的母亲了
She will be looking after your mother, for the rest of her life.

40
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:59,072
我真后悔没给神父弗洛德写信说说你 露丝
I wish I had written to Father Flood about you, Rose.

41
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:01,067
提我干嘛 我已经有工作了
Me? I have a job.

42
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,065
而你只有每周日去给刺头凯莉干几个钟头活
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.

43
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,071
你不应该这么叫她
You should not call her that.

44
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:08,055
这名字已经很友好了
I think it's quite a kind name,

45
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:11,002
你不想想她实际上是个可怕的老巫婆
considering she's actually a terrible old witch.

46
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,095
好了 我不想再提她了
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.

47
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:15,014
好啊
Good.

48
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,047
他们说那边夏天比这热 冬天比这冷
They say it's hotter there in the summer, and colder in the winter.

49
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,041
老天 她的衣服怎么办
What in Heaven's name will she do about clothes?

50
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:26,044
她会买新的 妈妈
She'll buy them, mother.

51
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,028
她不想浪费钱添置新衣
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.

52
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,041
她也没办法 她得在那儿待…
She won't have much choice. She'll be there for...

53
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:49,001
-你看起来美极了 南希  -谢谢
- You look beautiful, Nancy. - Thank you.

54
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,075
你漂亮到让我对这地方感到绝望
You look so beautiful it makes me despair of this place.

55
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:54,021
为什么
Why?

56
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:56,067
你是韦克斯福德郡最漂亮的女孩
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.

57
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,070
你应该可以选择你想要的任何一个男人
You should be able to choose any man you want.

58
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:02,009
我们却盼着橄榄球俱乐部的乔治·谢里丹 能够多看你几眼
And we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.

59
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,094
-你说他会吗   -他当然会
- Do you think he might? - Of course he will.

60
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:09,032
我知道你喜欢他 南希 可他又不是加里·库珀 对吧
I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?

61
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:09,032
Gary Cooper  美国演员 代表作 《约克军曹》

62
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:13,032
那些男孩们 打着发油 穿着休闲外套
And those boys with their hair-oil and their blazers…

63
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,006
他眼睛好迷人
He has beautiful eyes.

64
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:18,072
嗯 他会走进市集广场里漂亮的商店
Hmm. And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the Market Square.

65
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,092
你怎么不穿那条蓝色连衣裙
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?

66
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,087
你是在问我 怎么不用心打扮吗
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?

67
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,001
我想是因为我要离开这儿了
I suppose because I'm going away.

68
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:33,044
快来
Come on.

69
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,010
他往咱们这边看了两次了
He's looked over here twice already.

70
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,012
不会吧
He hasn't!

71
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:09,034
他朝我们走过来了
He's walking over here now.

72
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,045
你骗我
He's not!

73
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:14,004
我为什么要骗你乔治·谢里丹在干嘛
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan’s doing?

74
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,054
能赏脸跳支舞吗
Would you like to dance?

75
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,054
这就是你的全部家当吗
Is that really everything you own?

76
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:15,024
哦 艾莉丝 我应该把你照顾得更好的
Oh, Eilis. I should have looked after you better.

77
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:18,012
箱子里大部分衣服都是你买给我的
You've bought most of these clothes in this case.

78
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,077
这也是我离开的原因之一啊
That's one of the reasons I'm going,

79
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,037
我买不起自己的衣服
because I can't buy my own.

80
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,043
如果只是这样 我会把我所有的钱都开开心心地花在你身上
If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you, gladly.

81
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:30,047
但我没法给你买一个未来
But I can't buy you a future.

82
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,089
你想要的生活 我买不到
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.

83
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,021
我懂
I know.

84
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:40,017
-不过你哪天会来看我的吧   -当然
- But you'll come see me there one day?   -Yes.

85
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:44,077
你会好好照顾自己的吧
And you'll look after yourself?

86
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,010
你不用担心我
You don't have to worry about me.

87
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,017
那我以后也会回家看看的 对吗
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?

88
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,060
因为我受不了 要是…
Because I couldn't bear it if...

89
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,038
你的鞋子还没打包呢
You haven't packed your shoes yet.

90
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,001
鞋子有点占空间
They'll take up a bit of room.

91
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,012
好了
There.

92
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:54,013
不好意思
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,019
起来
Off!

94
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:09,033
1号下铺
Number one. Bottom bunk.

95
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,007
这是我的位子 你在上面
That's mine. You're on the top.

96
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:21,063
简直是地狱 再不来了
This is hell. Never again.

97
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:23,052
不再去美国吗
Never again to America?

98
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:25,074
从美国回家就是个错误
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.

99
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,086
我愿意做任何事 只要能不待在这可怕的船舱里
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.

100
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:33,010
-去抽根烟吧  -我不抽烟
- Let's go for a smoke. - I don't.

101
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:36,059
随便你吧 回头见
Suit yourself. I'll see you later.

102
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:38,094
说不好我能在头等舱遇到个好男人一起抽一根
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.

103
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,056
很好 看来并不是每个人都因为天气预报而推迟了晚餐
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.

104
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:04,049
据说今晚天气不好
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight,

105
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:06,025
所以其他乘客都没来吃晚餐
so none of the other passengers are eating.

106
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:09,076
顶多喝几勺汤 炖羊肉都没人吃
A few spoonfuls of soup, maybe, but not the mutton stew.

107
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,061
拜托开门
Please unlock it.

108
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,050
走开 门关着呢
Go away, it is closed.

109
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:11,081
对不起 我搞得臭气熏天的 还有这桶脏东西
I'm sorry about the smell, and the bucket.

110
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:14,046
别担心了 整艘船都臭死了
Don't worry. The whole boat stinks.

111
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,097
头等舱也一样
Even First Class.

112
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,045
我刚从那被赶出来
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.

113
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:20,064
洗手间的门整夜都锁着
The bathroom door was locked all night.

114
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,049
噢 那些混蛋
Oh, those bastards.

115
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:55,040
好了 尽管不算舒适 但起码洗手间是我们的了
There. It won't be very comfortable. But at least it's ours.

116
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,069
开门
Open the door.

117
00:12:57,071 --> 00:13:00,098
滚蛋 听到没 滚 蛋
Fuck off! Do you hear me? Fuck off!

118
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,049
要是昨晚你们友好一点的话 我们会公平行事
If you had been nice last night, we would have played fair.

119
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:06,037
你们现在没得用了 混蛋
Now you've got no toilet, you bastards.

120
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,017
好了 你去用洗手间吧 我去给咱们打些水
Go on, you can use it. I'm gonna get us some water.

121
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,083
你只许喝水
That's all you're allowed.

122
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,003
你要去美国生活吗
You going to live in America?

123
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:23,047
证件和其他什么准备好了吗
You have papers and everything?

124
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:26,007
嗯 还找了一份工作
Yes. And a job.

125
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,029
你是怎么安排好这一切的
How did you manage to arrange all that?

126
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:31,093
不是我 有人帮我的 是我姐姐认识的一位神父
I didn't. Someone did it for me. A priest my sister knows.

127
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:33,096
那你什么感觉
And how do you feel about it?

128
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,064
爱尔兰的信寄给我要多久
How long do the letters from Ireland take to arrive?

129
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,020
我姐姐露丝说她会马上写信给我
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.

130
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:47,086
刚开始会觉得要等很久 时间长了就不觉得了
They take a long time at first, and then no time at all.

131
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:51,013
在美国有家人吗 朋友呢
You have family in America? Friends?

132
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,052
没有
No.

133
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:54,005
放心 你很容易能结识人
You'll meet people easy enough.

134
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,047
你住哪儿
Where are you gonna live?

135
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,087
布鲁克林吗
Brooklyn?

136
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,060
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

137
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:59,063
乱猜的
Lucky guess.

138
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:04,027
记住 有时能跟陌生人聊聊挺好的
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.

139
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:06,040
和陌生人聊天是这种感觉吗
That's what it's like?

140
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:07,064
就是那样
That's what it's like.

141
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,056
-我已经好几个小时没想吐了  -很棒啊 不是吗
- I've been sick for hours.  -Nice, isn't it?

142
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,096
我好饿
I am very hungry.

143
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,085
嗯 所以你才好几个小时都没想吐了
Hmm, that's why you haven't been sick for hours.

144
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,015
我们明天就能吃了
We'll eat tomorrow.

145
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,099
或者后天
Or the day after.

146
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:35,076
噢 亲爱的 我们得帮你改改造型
Oh, dear. We'll have to do something with you.

147
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,033
他们会把你隔离的
They'll put you in quarantine or something

148
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:39,020
要是你以这副面貌入境的话
if you try to enter the country looking like that.

149
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,045
别太花俏 你不能看起来像妓女
Nothing fancy. You mustn't look like a tart.

150
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,076
噢 好吧 看起来像妓女倒并不成问题
Oh, Well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.

151
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,050
这件看起来不算糟
This doesn't look too bad.

152
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:52,085
我姐给我的
My sister gave me that.

153
00:14:55,096 --> 00:15:00,016
穿这个搭一下
Wear it with this…

154
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,061
还有这件
and this.

155
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:10,008
准备开包检查
Open your bags ready for inspection.

156
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,067
也别看起来太天真了
Don't look too innocent, though.

157
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:15,041
我会给你上点口红和睫毛膏
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.

158
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:18,074
也许再画个眼线
Perhaps some eye-liner.

159
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:34,052
你从队列里出来 谢谢 下一个 谢谢
You step out of the line please. Thank you. Next, please. Thank you.

160
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
护照
Passport please.

161
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,015
站直了
Stand up straight.

162
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:44,091
把鞋子擦亮 无论如何别咳嗽
Polish your shoes, and don't cough whatever you do.

163
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:52,020
不要粗鲁 别咄咄逼人 也别紧张兮兮
Don't be rude, or pushy, and don't look too nervous.

164
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,079
这边来
This way!

165
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:56,067
像美国人一样思考
Think like an American.

166
00:15:58,035 --> 00:16:00,018
你得知道自己要去哪儿
You have to know where you're going.

167
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:03,058
欢迎来到美国 女士 请从蓝色门进
Welcome to the United States, Ma'am. Through the blue door, please.

168
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,051
下一个
Next, please.

169
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:52,002
上帝保佑我们 感谢我主慷慨赐予
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive

170
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:54,026
我们即将享用的食物 阿门
from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.

171
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,029
阿门
Amen.

172
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,011
我看你收到一封信 戴安娜 有什么新鲜事吗
I saw you had a letter today, Diana. Any news?

173
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:05,024
她说德瓦莱拉先生眼睛又做了一次手术
Mr. de Valera has had another operation on his eyes, she says.

174
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,004
我不想听报纸上就能看的消息
I don't want news that I can read in a newspaper.

175
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,021
不管怎样 我们认为德瓦莱拉先生是政治人物
Anyway, we would describe Mr. de Valera as "politics",

176
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,051
不是吗 凯赫夫人
would we not, Mrs. Kehoe?

177
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,085
我们不想吃饭的时候谈政治
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.

178
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,069
我们不喜欢
We don't.

179
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:16,066
眼科手术又不是政治
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.

180
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,077
但这眼睛是政客的眼睛
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.

181
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,063
而且我也不怎么喜欢谈医院的事情
And I do not like to talk about hospitals very much, either.

182
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:24,007
帕蒂 那面霜有没办法买到
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?

183
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,031
我问了卖化妆品的泰勒小姐
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.

184
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,045
还给她看了那广告
And I showed her the advertisement.

185
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,025
我可不想长途跋涉
I don't want to have to travel all the way

186
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,094
跑去曼哈顿就为了买一罐面霜
to Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.

187
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,092
艾莉丝 能帮我看看巴尔托奇百货有没有吗
Maybe you could have a look at Bartocci's for me, Eilis?

188
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:34,053
好的 凯赫夫人
Yes, Mrs. Kehoe.

189
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:36,025
对啊 巴尔托奇百货准有
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.

190
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:38,009
凯赫夫人 她根本不能肯定
She does not know for sure, Mrs. Kehoe.

191
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:40,037
她说巴尔托奇百货比韦博斯特百货好
She is only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's

192
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:41,043
只是为了气帕蒂
to get at Patty.

193
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,094
它们都很好
They are both very good,

194
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,079
你们这些姑娘能在里面工作都很幸运
and you girls are very lucky to be working there.

195
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:50,059
艾莉丝 你看起来是油性皮肤 对吗
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin, is that right?

196
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:51,086
你平时怎么护理的
What do you do about that?

197
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:58,041
就 呃 就清洗呗 凯赫夫人 用肥皂
Just... Well, I wash it, Mrs. Kehoe, with soap.

198
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,095
用肥皂没什么不好
There is nothing wrong with soap.

199
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:02,049
我猜主觉得肥皂就够好了
Soap was good enough for our Lord. I expect.

200
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:04,082
那主用的是哪个牌子呢 麦克亚当小姐
Well, which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?

201
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,041
圣经会告诉你这个吗
Does the Bible tell you that?

202
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,026
反正主是个男人
Our Lord was a man, anyway.

203
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:09,084
他可不在乎皮肤油
He didn't care about greasy skin.

204
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:13,085
姑娘们 就餐时不要再谈主的皮肤了 拜托
Ladies. No more talk about our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.

205
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:16,075
姑娘们会帮你找到合适的护肤品的 艾莉丝 是吧 姑娘们
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis, won't you, the girls?

206
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:40,091
巴尔托奇百货

207
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,003
-你好  -早上好
- Hi.  - Good Morning.

208
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,064
昨晚出去玩了吗
Did you go out last night?

209
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,067
-出去玩 宅在家的反义词  -没有
- Out. The opposite of in .  - No.

210
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,050
我昨晚和男朋友去看电影了
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.

211
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:05,003
你看到什么了 桃乐丝
"What did you see, Dorothy?"

212
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:08,034
我看了《蓬门今始为君开》 艾莉丝 他们在爱尔兰拍的
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis. They filmed it in Ireland."

213
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:09,062
是吗 我家乡是爱尔兰
"Oh, I'm from Ireland".

214
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,028
我知道 所以我以为你会感兴趣
"I know you are, that's why I thought you might be interested."

215
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,044
谢谢你
Thank you.

216
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:18,044

217
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,028
稍等片刻
Shouldn't be a moment.

218
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,055
外面还热吗
Is it still hot out there?

219
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,054
从早上到现在我都没出去过
I haven't been outside since this morning

220
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:54,090
不过我猜可能
but I can tell that it might be.

221
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:58,087
挺热的... 看上去是这样
Very. It just..looks it.

222
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,036
的确挺暖和的
It's warm, yes.

223
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,054
多谢
Thanks very much.

224
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:18,092
你记住如果人家觉得这儿好就会再来
Remember ... If people like it here, they will come back.

225
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:21,066
所以你要像交新朋友那样对待每位顾客
So you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.

226
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,048
我会尽力的
I will try.

227
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:25,002
尽力是不够的 这是你必须做到的
It's not a matter of trying. It's what you have to do.

228
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:27,026
你会每天尽力穿内裤吗
Do you try to wear panties every day?

229
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:29,055
不会
No.

230
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:32,050
我是说我不是尽力穿上 而是肯定会穿
I mean, I don't..I don't try. I just put them on.

231
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,093
你明白我的意思了吧
You see what I'm saying?

232
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,028
- 明白 - 那就好
- Yes. - Good.

233
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,008
给我一份切片吐司
Can I get another sliced toast please?

234
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:46,059
做些热狗
Slice up some hot dog.

235
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,011
他们要中间切开的
They want them sliced down the middle!

236
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:56,035
你好 我要买单
Sorry. Could I have the bill please?

237
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:04,008
我希望当我走入天国之门时
I hope that when I go through the pearly gates,

238
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:05,038
迎接我的是你
the first sound I hear is you

239
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,034
用那可爱的爱尔兰口音找我买单
asking me for the check in that lovely Irish brogue.

240
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:05,073
他们有没有告诉你什么时候尼龙袜打折啊 艾莉丝
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?

241
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:08,028
这儿还没住过在巴尔托奇百货上班的女孩呢
We've never had a Bartocci's girl living here.

242
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:10,083
说不定我们能得到些内部消息
We might get some inside information.

243
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,022
我还没听到什么消息
I haven't been told anything.

244
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:14,021
就算你听说了也不会告诉我们的吧
I'll bet you wouldn't let on if you had.

245
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:16,073
她就是这种人 忠于老板多过朋友
She's that sort. More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.

246
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:17,089
像个红色特务
Like a Red spy.

247
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:19,020
哦上帝啊
Oh, dear God.

248
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:23,042
谢谢你把上帝扯进一段关于尼龙袜的谈话
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.

249
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:27,009
即使上帝无所不在也绝不会出现在巴尔托奇的打折特卖会上
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.

250
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,035
对不起 凯赫夫人
Sorry Mrs. Kehoe.

251
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:31,033
你今天终于收到家书了 艾莉丝 真替你高兴
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.

252
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,091
- 真的吗 -恩
- Did I? - Em.

253
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:33,076
我忘了看了
I forgot to check.

254
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:36,024
你先吃完再看也不急嘛
They'll still be there after dinner.

255
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,080
哦 抱歉
Oh sorry.

256
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,086
亲爱的艾莉丝
Dear Eilis,

257
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:56,028
难以置信读这封信时你身在美国
It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America.

258
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,067
远隔重洋
Thousands of miles across the sea.

259
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:02,051
这边的大事情就是
The big news here is that since you left,

260
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:05,012
你走后妈妈就不再去刺头凯莉的店买东西了
Mummy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.

261
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:08,023
你知道的 她的面包不怎么新鲜
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh.

262
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:10,007
东西都太贵
And she overcharge for everything.

263
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:12,031
人品还不好
And she's awful.

264
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:15,025
我没当面告诉她 没这个必要
I haven't told her to her face.There's no need.

265
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:18,003
她自己知道她的东西贵 又不新鲜
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.

266
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:22,078
当然我们每天都谈起你
We talk about you every evening, of course.

267
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,057
我们想知道关于你的一切
We want to know everything.

268
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:31,019
你一定很忙 但即使你的信有两百页这么长
I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were two hundred pages,

269
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:33,017
你的母亲也会觉得不够长
they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.

270
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:42,017
照顾好自己 爱你
Take care of yourself. Love.

271
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,007
你这几天月事来了吗
Is it your time of the month?

272
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:00,046
那你是怎么了
So what is it?

273
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:07,098
去员工室休息一下吧
Take some time off now. Go and sit in the staff room.

274
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:20,021
对不起艾莉丝 都怪我不好
I'm so sorry, Eilis. This is all my fault.

275
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:23,025
我以为你不再需要人照看了
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.

276
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,090
弗兰科·巴尔托奇说你工作很棒
Franco Bartocci says you are doing great here.

277
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:28,067
玛·凯赫说你是她见过最好的房客
Ma Kehoe says you are the nicest lodger she's ever had.

278
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:31,024
- 怎么了 - 你叫她玛·凯赫吗
- What? - Ma Kehoe?

279
00:24:31,027 --> 00:24:33,029
千万别当面这么叫她
Don't ever call her that to her face.

280
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:37,059
我已经忘了背井离乡的滋味有多苦
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.

281
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:40,088
我帮你在夜校报了名
I've enrolled you in a night class.

282
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:43,063
布鲁克林大学学记帐
For book-keeping. The Brooklyn College.

283
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,092
每周三次
It will be three nights a week.

284
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:46,087
第一学期的学费也帮你付了
And I've paid your tuition for the first semester.

285
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,008
- 为什么 - 干嘛问为什么
- Why? - “Why?”

286
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,037
你应该谢谢我啊
Not "Thank you"?

287
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,091
对不起 谢谢你 但是为什么呢
Sorry, thank you. But why?

288
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:57,004
我很吃惊像你这样聪明的人
I was amazed that someone as clever as you

289
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:59,014
在家乡居然找不到好工作
couldn't find proper work at home.

290
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:01,090
我在这儿呆了太多年了
I've been here too long.

291
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:03,098
都忘了爱尔兰啥样了
I forget what it's like in Ireland.

292
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,028
所以当你姐姐写信告诉我你的事
So when your sister wrote to me about you

293
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:09,022
我就说教会会想办法帮忙的
I said that the Church would try to help.

294
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:13,076
反正布鲁克林需要多些我们爱尔兰女孩
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.

295
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:17,043
真希望我能停止想回家的冲动
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.

296
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:20,055
我能告诉你的是 这种感觉会过去的
All I can say is that it will pass.

297
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,050
思乡病和其他毛病一样
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.

298
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:28,007
它让人难受 但终究会转移到其他人身上去
It will make you feel wretched, and then it will move on to somebody else.

299
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,011
泰勒诉标准燃气公司案
Now, Taylor versus Standard Gas Co

300
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:35,028
是过去二十年内最高法院审判的
is one of the most important corporate cases

301
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:38,014
最重要的商事案件之一
decided in the Supreme Court in the last twenty years.

302
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,077
它推动了了「深石原则」的确立
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock doctrine,

303
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,085
它可以说是子母公司法领域的里程碑
so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.

304
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:50,034
仅在公用事业整合的进程中
In public utility integration proceedings alone

305
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:52,066
就有成千上万的投资者
literally thousands of investors

306
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:54,081
因此受到影响
may be affected by its application.

307
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:01,086
你听得懂他说的这些吗
Did you understand any of that?

308
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,099
随便哪部分
I mean, a single word?

309
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,097
他都不用照着书念
He's not even reading from a book.

310
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,034
全在他脑子里
He just knows all this.

311
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:13,001
希望接下来的内容会简单点吧
Well, Let's hope the next hour is easier.

312
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:29,007
在美国火鸡是毁掉圣诞节的众多事物之一
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.

313
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:30,094
像在吃木屑
It all tastes of sawdust.

314
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:32,096
那麦克亚当小姐就吃芝士三明治
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam,

315
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:34,089
她那份火鸡就分给大家了
and extra turkey for everyone else.

316
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:37,063
姑娘们 矜持点
Ladies, please.

317
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:41,080
艾莉丝 弗洛德神父把你的圣诞安排告诉我了
Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.

318
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:45,014
你不会要给无家可归的老年人发放午饭吧
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?

319
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:47,075
神父每年都请我们去 我们从来不去
He asks us every year. We always say no.

320
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:49,086
艾莉丝 你真是个圣人 那些人体味很大的
Ellis, you're a saint. They smell awful.

321
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:52,083
希拉知道他们有体味因为她要找的老公就在他们中间
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband-hunting.

322
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:59,017
艾莉丝 你做的很好 很仁慈
It's a marvelous thing you're doing, Eilis. A Christian thing.

323
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,094
真希望有更多像你这样的人
I wish there were more like you.

324
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:06,009
请进
You can come.

325
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,080
大概会来多少人
How many are we expecting?

326
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:11,001
去年来了百来号人 今年可能更多
There were a hundred last year. There may be more this.

327
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:13,065
- 都是爱尔兰人吗 - 是的
- They all Irish? - All Irish.

328
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:16,064
他们为什么不回爱尔兰呢
Why don't they go home?

329
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:20,022
如果你这样年轻有才的女孩都没有发展空间
If there's nothing there for a clever young girl such as yourself,

330
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:22,040
他们这样的人就更没有生存可能了
there's gonna be even less for men like these.

331
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:24,090
有些人来了快五十年了
Some of them have been here fifty years,

332
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,013
和老家都联系不上了
they have lost touch with everyone.

333
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:28,006
圣诞快乐
Happy Christmas.

334
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:30,047
- 圣诞快乐 - 谢谢
- Merry Christmas. - Thank you.

335
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,013
就是他们这些人
These are the men who built ...

336
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:35,056
造了隧道 大桥 公路
the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.

337
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,099
没人知道他们现在靠什么生存
God alone knows what they live on now.

338
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:02,050
不好意思要打扰下大家
I don't want to interrupt the proceedings,

339
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:05,087
不过我相信大家都想谢谢
but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation

340
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:08,039
辛苦了一整天的女士们
to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.

341
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:10,001
为表谢意
And by way of a thank you,

342
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:12,043
有位非常棒的歌手要为我们献上一曲
we have a great singer in the room with us today.

343
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:13,069
有请弗兰基
Frankie.

344
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:22,014
来客厅喝一杯吧
Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?

345
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:23,084
你应得的
You've earned it.

346
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:30,066
- 你挺过来了 - 嗨 也没那么糟啦
- You survived! - Oh it wasn't so bad.

347
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:35,095
- 圣诞快乐 - 干杯
- Happy Christmas! - Cheers.

348
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,060
麦克亚当小姐要搬走了
Now Miss McAdam is leaving us.

349
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:45,090
她去曼哈顿和姐姐一起住
She is going to live with her sister in Manhattan.

350
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,090
她住的是最好的一间房
She has the best room in the house.

351
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:52,021
就是地下室 那儿有独立的门
The basement. And it has its own entrance.

352
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:58,007
我只让某类女孩住地下室
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.

353
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,097
我指的不是长相
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.

354
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,063
尽管我承认上天给麦克亚当小姐的长相
Although I will admit that God did give Miss McAdam an advantage,

355
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:05,010
在我考虑让谁单独住在地下室的时候成了优势
when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.

356
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:09,002
艾莉丝你和她不同 你是漂亮女孩 但你也明事理
No no, you're a pretty girl Eilis. But you're sensible.

357
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:12,009
所以地下室给你住 就这么定了
So, you're having the room and that's that.

358
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,009
其他女孩不会有意见吗
Would the other girls not mind?

359
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:17,017
她们肯定有意见 不过她们对什么没意见呢
Oh, I expect so. What don't they mind?

360
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,009
姑娘们 你们会带桃乐丝去周六晚上的舞会吧
Girls, you'll take Dolores to dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?

361
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:27,009
有舞会吗
There's a dance?

362
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,039
在教区礼堂
At the parish hall.

363
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,095
不提供酒精饮料 不过你不需要那东西也能玩的挺开心
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.

364
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:34,099
帕蒂和我这周不去跳舞
Umm, Patty and I aren't going this week.

365
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:38,003
我们去看电影
We're going to see a movie instead.

366
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:40,071
看电影桃乐丝肯定也乐意吧
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.

367
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,050
我很喜欢的
I would, very much.

368
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:45,041
纽约的电影比卡文那儿多多了
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.

369
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:48,035
是啊 完全没想到 本以为该是完全相反呢
Yes, surprising, isn't it? You'd think it would be the other way around.

370
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:54,074
欢迎你和我们一起去看 桃乐丝
Of course, you'd be welcome to join us, Dolores.

371
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,096
只要你不介意当电灯泡
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.

372
00:31:57,018 --> 00:32:01,014
这么说你俩都在几天里奇迹般地找到男朋友了对吧
So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?

373
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:05,034
我祝福你们这回不要再重蹈覆辙了
Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.

374
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:08,070
- 你去舞会吗 艾莉丝 - 我会去的 凯赫夫人
- Will you be going, Eilis? - Yes, Mrs Kehoe.

375
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,033
那你带着桃乐丝吧
Well, you can take Dolores, then.

376
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,095
没问题
Of course.

377
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:36,088
天哪 这儿人好少哦
God, there's nobody here.

378
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,028
人都没有怎么找对象啊
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?

379
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:43,006
大部分人九点之后才来吧
I expect most people will come after nine.

380
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,018
来人还是男人
People? Or fellas?

381
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:48,051
总会来些男人啊
Some of the people will be fellas.

382
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:51,028
好想认识个男人啊
I'd love to meet a fella.

383
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,070
她们还是来了 两个骗子
They came! The liars!

384
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:59,016
真是一对贱人
What a pair of bitches.

385
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:04,036
老太婆就是这么叫她们的 她说她们都是贱人
That's what the old woman called them. She said they were all bitches,

386
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:07,003
除了你
apart from you.

387
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,088
你好啊
Well hello.

388
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:22,002
见到你们真好
Hello. It's good to see you.

389
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:23,004
我懂你
I can see why.

390
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:26,022
跟我们来
Come with us.

391
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:43,039
这样好看多了
There. That's better.

392
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,085
终于不像刚挤完牛奶进屋了
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.

393
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,064
我以前看上去像吗
Is that what I looked like?

394
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:51,007
有点像 挤的是干净的奶牛
Just a bit. Nice clean cows.

395
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:56,053
一 二 三
1, 2, 3 ...

396
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,052
跳的不错
Not bad.

397
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,091
过一会我们再跳吧
Maybe we could have a dance later?

398
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,019
- 你说什么 - 过一会再跳
- Sorry? - A dance later.

399
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:15,080
好啊
Oh sure.

400
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,090
想跳舞吗
Would you like to dance?

401
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:33,091
你和那个教你跳舞的男的一起的吗
Are you here with that guy? The one who was teaching you to dance?

402
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,044
不是
No.

403
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,084
那你能和我跳舞吗
So would you dance with me?

404
00:34:37,046 --> 00:34:39,074
他没教会我啥
I'm not sure he taught me anything.

405
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:43,017
没关系 跳舞的秘诀是要装作很会跳的样子
Doesn't matter. The secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.

406
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:45,093
哦 真希望有人早点告诉我
Ah. I wish someone had told me that years ago.

407
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,018
来吧
Come on.

408
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:26,029
- 你住哪儿 - 克林顿大街
- Where do you live? - Clinton Street.

409
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:29,057
真的吗 和我同路
Yeah? That's on my way home.

410
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:32,081
能陪你走回家吗
Can I walk you?

411
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:37,008
我会先答应你 然后告诉你原因
I'm going to say yes, and then I'm going to tell you why.

412
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,013
为了不让我误解你的意思吗
So I don't get the wrong idea?

413
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:40,039
算是吧
I suppose so.

414
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,021
有没有一个穿白衣的姑娘
Is there a girl in a white shirt

415
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:45,075
独自坐在那里
sitting on her own over there?

416
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:51,043
你不会认识她吧
You don't know her?

417
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:52,091
我认识
I do.

418
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:56,057
我们住在同一个寄宿家庭 她很烦人
She lives in my boarding house, and she's awful.

419
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:59,014
如果我跟你一起走了 我相信她会理解我的
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.

420
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,031
你这是在救我
You'd be rescuing me.

421
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:02,001
我知道了
I get it.

422
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:27,016
- 我不是爱尔兰人 - 听口音就不是
- I'm not Irish. - You don't sound Irish.

423
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:33,073
我得声明一下 我没有半点爱尔兰血统
I need to make this clear. No part of me is Irish.

424
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:36,086
我父母不是爱尔兰人 祖父母也不是 也没有爱尔兰亲戚
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.

425
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:40,043
我是意大利后裔 我爸妈都是意大利人
I'm an Italian. Well, my my parents are, anyway.

426
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:42,035
那你为什么跑来爱尔兰人的舞会
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?

427
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:44,030
意大利人不跳舞吗
Don't the Italians have dances?

428
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,083
跳啊 可我不想带你去意大利人的舞会
Yeah. And I wouldn't want to take you to one.

429
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:48,091
他们表现得太意式风格了
They behave like Italians all night.

430
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:50,008
什么意思
What does that mean?

431
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,053
- 噢 你懂的     -不懂
- Oh, you know. - No.

432
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:56,052
-他们的手势 - 太多了吗
- Hands. - Too many of them?

433
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:59,056
对于一个女孩子来说 我想是的
Oh,my. I guess it could seem that way, if it was a girl.

434
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:01,009
听着
Listen

435
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:05,065
我想开诚布公地告诉你
I want everything out in the open.

436
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:12,074
我参加爱尔兰人的舞会 是因为我真心喜欢爱尔兰姑娘
I came to the Irish dance because I really like Irish girls.

437
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:15,078
而我是当中唯一肯跟你跳舞的吗
And I was the only one who would dance with you?

438
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,032
噢 不是这样的
Oh, no, it wasn't...

439
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,041
是吗 那你跟很多姑娘都跳过舞咯
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?

440
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:30,047
我到了
This is me.

441
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,020
下周我能来接你去舞会吗 先去吃点东西好吗
Can I take you next week? Maybe get something to eat first?

442
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:40,077
行啊
That'd be nice.

443
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:43,086
晚安
Good night.

444
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,098
您的餐
There you go.

445
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:08,079
你不工作的时候做什么
So...What do you do when you're not working?

446
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:15,069
嗯 我上课 在布鲁克林大学
Well. There's school. Just, you know...Brooklyn College.

447
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:17,062
我在学记账
I'm studying book-keeping.

448
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:19,015
你想当簿记员吗
You want to be a book-keeper?

449
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:24,019
嗯 有朝一日我想当一个会计 不过 先做好簿记员吧
Well, I want to be an accountant one day. But, yes, book-keeping first.

450
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:27,076
哇 难吗
Wow. Is that difficult?

451
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:31,077
我说得够多了 跟我说说你修管道的工作吧
I'm talking too much. Tell me about plumbing.

452
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,068
-修管道的事情你已经知道的够多了 -我什么都不懂
- You know enough about plumbing already. - I don't know anything.

453
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:40,022
你只要知道水龙头会渗水 厕所会堵塞
You know that taps drip and toilets get blocked

454
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:42,005
这样就够了
and that's all you need to know.

455
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:44,016
我对记账一无所知
I don't know anything about book-keeping.

456
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:50,055
好吧 说起来挺复杂的
Well.There's a lot to it.

457
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:51,056
当然有很多数学
There's all the maths, of course,

458
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,042
但不太复杂
but that's not so complicated.

459
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:56,018
复式记账法要花好些时间去掌握
The double entry system, that takes a while to get used to.

460
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:59,064
我们还要学公司法 这门课最让我头疼
And we study company law, too, and that terrifies me.

461
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:03,059
我们要阅读一家在三十年代破产的保险公司的相关信息
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s,

462
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:05,085
学习涉及的相关法律问题
and all the the legal issues that went along with that...

463
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:08,022
她会打高尔夫 打得非常好
She plays golf, and she's really good at it.

464
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:10,073
如果她去了上周六的舞会
And if she'd been at the dance last Saturday,then...

465
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:14,036
你不会多看我一眼 因为露丝太美了
I don't think you'd have looked at me twice, because Rose is beautiful.

466
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:18,071
我有点担心 你的菜都没有动
I'm worried you haven't eaten anything.

467
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,092
光顾着说话了
Too busy talking.

468
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:33,024
你们两个丫头今天又是哪出
What is the matter with you girls now?

469
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:35,001
有问题的不是我俩 凯赫夫人
Nothing is matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.

470
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:37,074
是不是因为艾莉丝找了个男友
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?

471
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:39,045
艾莉丝的男友吗
Eilis'  young man?

472
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:42,041
我们不知道 她对此事只字不提
We didn't know. She won't say anything about it.

473
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:45,086
她干嘛要对你们这些爱传八卦的家伙提起呢
And why should she, to you awful gossip-mongers?

474
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:48,072
反正我在周六晚上遇到了这个小伙子
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night ...

475
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:51,053
那会他来找艾莉丝 他是个绅士
when he called for Eilis, and he is a gentleman.

476
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,081
凯赫夫人 快给我们多讲讲他
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?

477
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,036
我们知道他长得挺帅
We know he's quite nice-looking.

478
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:56,098
我不太喜欢他穿的鞋
I didn't like his shoes much.

479
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,087
他的鞋怎么了
What on earth is wrong with the shoes?

480
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,049
颜色很滑稽
They were a funny color.

481
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:03,093
我跟你们说
I'll tell you this much:

482
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:07,073
我要请弗洛德神父举办一场布道训诫你们轻浮的危害
I am going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.

483
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,096
我现在把轻浮看作是第八宗罪
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.

484
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:16,046
女人的轻浮和男人的懒惰是一样的罪恶
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man,

485
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:19,046
轻浮的笑声更不能容忍 立刻 不许再笑了
and the noise she makes is a lot worse. Now, enough.

486
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,067
好 考虑一下
Yeah. Think about it. You can...

487
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:32,048
好好好
Yeah,yeah.

488
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:45,071
我只是想陪你回家
All I want to do is travel home with you.

489
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:48,031
不去吃饭 也不去喝酒 什么都不干
No food, no drink, no nothing.

490
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:51,027
我知道你要学习 然后好好睡一会儿
I know you got to study and get some sleep.

491
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,021
我只要送你回到家 说句晚安
I'll take you to your house and say goodnight.

492
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:58,047
不然我等不了那么久了
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.

493
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:09,053
我想问你一件事 你听了会说 噢 太早了
I want to ask you something. And you're gonna say, "oh, it's too soon."

494
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:12,082
我还不太了解他 我们只是见了几次
"I don't really know him well enough, we've only been out a couple times."

495
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:15,061
我想问的不是什么坏事 只不过大部分男人都会在
Oh, it's nothing so bad. It is just something that most guys...

496
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:18,077
请直接问吧 你这样让我紧张
Please just ask. You're beginning to terrify me.

497
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,077
噢 好 你愿意哪天来我家吃饭 见见我的家人吗
Oh. Sure. Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?

498
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,064
这就是你要问的吗
That's it?

499
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,000
我愿意
I'd love to.

500
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:34,023
你喜欢意大利菜吗
You like italian food?

501
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,025
不确定 我没吃过
Don't know. I've never eaten it.

502
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,085
意大利菜是世界上最棒的美食
It is the best food in the world.

503
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:39,044
那我有什么理由不喜欢呢
Well, why would not I like it?

504
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:42,057
你心情不错哈
You're in a good mood, huh?

505
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:45,035
是啊 怎么了
Yes, why?

506
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:51,090
只是 我喜欢你这个样子 我不知道怎么形容
It's just... I like how you're being, I don't know the word.

507
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,069
当你对每件事都配合的时候
When you go along with everything.

508
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,021
顺从
Amenable?

509
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:59,061
是的 顺从
Yeah. Amenable. OK,

510
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,081
趁着你还顺从的时候
so while you're being amenable..

511
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:05,035
我们这周能在你没有课的晚上去看场电影吗
Can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night classes?

512
00:42:07,088 --> 00:42:09,094
我愿意看两场
I'll sign up for two movies.

513
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:12,013
- 真的吗 - 真的
- Really? - Yes.

514
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:14,036
就算第一次约会不顺利
Even if the first date is a disaster,

515
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,081
我会再给你一次机会
I'll give it another chance.

516
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,059
感觉上是这样的
It certainly feels like it,

517
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:32,087
但这是我第一年在这上班 所以我不知道如何判断
but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.

518
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:35,075
祝贺你 度过了第一个在纽约的冬天
Well congratulations. You survived your first New York winter.

519
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:37,033
噢 并不是那么糟糕
Ah, it wasn't so bad.

520
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:38,095
是吗 爱尔兰更冷吗
Really? It's colder in Ireland?

521
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,037
噢不 这儿更冷
Oh no, it's colder here.

522
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:43,087
我们评判冬天的标准就是看冬天有多冷
Over here, that's how we judge the winter. On how cold it is.

523
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:48,000
可是你们有暖气 到处都是 你们只有在室外冷
But you have heating. Heating everywhere. You're only cold outside.

524
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,080
倒也是
I guess that's true.

525
00:42:50,073 --> 00:42:53,009
-谢啦    -祝你一天愉快
- Thank you for your help. - Have a good day.

526
00:42:56,054 --> 00:43:00,020
艾莉丝 你跟变了个人似的
Eilis! You're like a different person!

527
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:01,026
你怎么做到的
How did you do it?

528
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:04,055
也许我可以把你的心得传授给下个想家的姑娘
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.

529
00:43:04,062 --> 00:43:07,022
我有男友了 一个意大利人
I met somebody. An Italian fella.

530
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,070
噢 不 我不会传达这样的建议的
Oh no. I'm not passing that on.

531
00:43:09,072 --> 00:43:12,016
我宁愿她们想家也不想她们失恋
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.

532
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:15,014
他常常谈论棒球吗 还是把他妈妈挂在嘴边
Does he talk about baseball all the time? Or his mother?

533
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,012
没有
No.

534
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:20,017
那得留住他 纽约再没有这样的意大利男人了
Then keep him. There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.

535
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:28,066
打住 记着 这是容易的 因为上面还没加酱
Hold it. Now remember You're getting off easy, because we haven't got sauce.

536
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:33,008
是的 你要记住酱汁会四处溅 所以要慢慢来
Yeah. You have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.

537
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,049
每次我看到动作有问题的时候 我就说 “溅了”
I'm gonna say "Splash" anytime I see problems.

538
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:39,003
-好主意    -我可以开始了吗
- Good idea. - Can I start now?

539
00:43:39,025 --> 00:43:40,051
-可以 -开始
- Yeah! - Go!

540
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,035
溅了
SPLASH!

541
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:01,016
你刚刚溅到他妈妈 他爸爸 还溅到墙上了
You just splashed his mother, and his father, and the walls...

542
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,062
再来一次吧
Let's go again.

543
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:07,078
亲爱的露丝 我想最重要的消息是
Dear Rose, I suppose the most important news

544
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,089
我交了个男朋友
is that I have a boyfriend

545
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:12,082
我清楚 他不如百货公司的工作重要
He isn't as important as Bartocci's ...

546
00:44:12,085 --> 00:44:14,066
也不如夜校的学习重要
and my evening classes, I know that.

547
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,085
但我想告诉你这里发生的一切
But I wanted to tell you everything that is going on.

548
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:19,073
请别跟妈妈说 你知道她会有什么反应
Please don't mention it to Mummy though. You know what's she like.

549
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:25,074
他为人得体又友善 他有一份工作并且很努力
He's decent and kind, and he has a job, and he works hard.

550
00:44:25,077 --> 00:44:27,054
我们每周三去看电影
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays

551
00:44:27,054 --> 00:44:30,026
周六他带我去弗洛德神父的舞会
and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.

552
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:35,017
我每天都想着你和妈妈
I think of you and mother every single day.

553
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:39,021
但是托尼令我觉得我在美国有了新生活
But Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here.

554
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:41,024
在遇到他之前 我没有
I didn't have before I met him.

555
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:46,021
以前 我的身体在这里 而我的生活停留在有你们的爱尔兰
My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.

556
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:49,043
现在在远隔重洋的地方开始了新生活
Now it's halfway across the sea.

557
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:51,065
这很了不起 不是吗
So that's something, isn't it?

558
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:07,078
对了 我得提醒你小心弗兰基
Oh and I’d better warned you about Frankie.

559
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,081
最小的那个
He's the little one.

560
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,046
是的 他少年老成
Yeah. He's eight going on eighteen.

561
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:13,018
他既友善又机灵 但总是话很多
He's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking

562
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,072
他有好多话要说给你听
and he's talking about all the things he's gonna to say to you.

563
00:45:15,074 --> 00:45:18,048
- 说什么呢 -不知道 可能是任何事情
- What sorts of things? - We don't know. Could be anything.

564
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:20,088
我试了给他钱
I mean, I swear I tried to pay him money to

565
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,056
让他出去跟朋友打球
go out and play ball with his friends.

566
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,025
我爸也威胁他不要乱来
And my dad, he threatened him,

567
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:26,093
可是我想他正巴望有机会制造麻烦
but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble

568
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:29,022
这样好痛快挨顿揍
so much so he'll happily take a beating.

569
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:30,088
这就是我家了
This is us here.

570
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,026
准备好了吗
Ready?

571
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,012
你在哪儿学的这么吃意面的
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?

572
00:45:53,002 --> 00:45:54,077
我有上课
I've been taking lessons.

573
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,095
上课 在课堂上吗 有这样的课吗
Lessons? Like, in a class? You can do that?

574
00:45:58,017 --> 00:45:59,045
也许我可以教你
Maybe I could teach you.

575
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,090
不 不 戴安娜 我的舍友
No, no. Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me...

576
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,029
她为我做了意面 逼我学着在不弄得一团糟的情况下吃掉它
cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.

577
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:10,032
你们在爱尔兰吃什么 爱尔兰炖菜吗
So, what do you eat in Ireland? Just Irish stew?

578
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,003
不止 我们
Not just. We...

579
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,076
首先我想说我们不喜欢爱尔兰人
So first of all I should say that we don't like Irish people.

580
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,040
打住 打住
Hey, hey ...

581
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,093
-弗兰基 - 怎么了
- Frankie! - What?

582
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,044
我们不喜欢爱尔兰人 人尽皆知的事实
We don't! That is a well known fact!

583
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:20,099
弗兰基 为什么呢
Why Frankie?

584
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,013
因为一伙爱尔兰人把毛里齐奥揍伤了
Because a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up

585
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,066
他缝了好几针
and he had to get stitches.

586
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:26,051
但这事根本没人管
And because all the cops round here are Irish,

587
00:46:26,055 --> 00:46:28,039
因为所有的警察都是爱尔兰人
nobody did anything about it.

588
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,098
这事也许有另外一面
There are probably two sides to it.

589
00:46:30,098 --> 00:46:34,078
可能我当时说了一些不该说的话 可是我现在想不起来了
I might have said something I shouldn't, you know, I can't remember now.

590
00:46:34,078 --> 00:46:36,011
不管 就是因为他们打了你
No, because they beat you up.

591
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:39,015
无论如何 他们可能不全是爱尔兰人
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.

592
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:41,008
对啊 他们只不过全是红头发 大粗腿而已
No. They just had red hair and big legs.

593
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:44,047
给我起来 失陪一下
Raise up! Excuse us.

594
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:50,022
我唯一能替他讲的好话就是他可能是我们之中唯一可以上大学的人
All I can say in his defence is that he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.

595
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:52,061
前提是他能把嘴闭上
If he can keep his mouth shut.

596
00:46:52,094 --> 00:46:56,014
托尼说你在上大学
So, Tony tells me go to college.

597
00:46:56,017 --> 00:46:58,061
只是夜校而已 我想当一名簿记员
Oh, just night classes. I want to be a book-keeper.

598
00:46:58,063 --> 00:47:00,034
我喜欢现在百货商场的工作
I like working in the shop well enough,

599
00:47:00,037 --> 00:47:02,004
但我不想一辈子待在那里
but I don't want to be there forever.

600
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:03,092
很好
Good.

601
00:47:04,094 --> 00:47:09,039
对不起 艾莉丝 我是个白痴 一个粗鲁的白痴
I'm sorry, Eilis. I'm an idiot.I'm a rude idiot.

602
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:19,022
托尼提出过赛季开始后带你去艾比兹球场看比赛吗
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbett's Field when the season starts?

603
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:22,024
你喜欢棒球吗
You like baseball?

604
00:47:23,086 --> 00:47:27,042
他从没提到布鲁克林道奇队吗 一次都没有吗
He never mentioned the Dodgers? Not even once?

605
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:28,047
托尼 你怎么了
Tony, what is the matter with you?

606
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:30,052
你们知道为什么吗 光顾着干这个了
You know why? Too much of this.

607
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:35,069
不管怎样 到了夏天你只能去艾比兹球场才能看到他了
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbett's Field if you want to see him in the summer.

608
00:47:35,071 --> 00:47:37,043
他们对你来说这么重要吗
They're that important to you?

609
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:38,060
这么说吧
Put it this way.

610
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,060
如果我们的孩子决定要支持扬基队或巨人队的话 我会很失望的
If our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants, it would break my heart.

611
00:47:42,063 --> 00:47:43,063
我也是
Mine too.

612
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:49,093
她可没在笑哦 托尼 我想已经晚了
She's not laughing, Tony. I think it's too late.

613
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:51,044
她支持扬基队
She's a Yanks fan.

614
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:55,016
你说什么呢 你怎么搞的
What are you talking about? What's wrong with you?

615
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:57,038
他是扬基队球迷
He's a Yanks fan.

616
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:20,045
我爱你
I love you.

617
00:48:23,097 --> 00:48:31,006
我... 谢谢你 今晚很开心
I..Thank you for the evening. It was lovely.

618
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:55,008
对不起
Sorry!

619
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:58,097
我已经用完了
I'd finished.

620
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:09,020
希拉 问你点事情可以吗
Sheila can I ask you something?

621
00:49:11,006 --> 00:49:12,070
你为什么还没结婚
Why are not you married?

622
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:18,097
因为我丈夫离开我 跟别人在一起了
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.

623
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:22,043
抱歉
Oh I'm sorry.

624
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:27,033
额 你会再结婚吗
And ... Well, would you get married again?

625
00:49:27,035 --> 00:49:31,075
- 是不是有人跟你求婚了 - 不 不算吧
- Has somebody asked you? - No, not really.

626
00:49:32,008 --> 00:49:33,064
我不会刨根问底的
I won't ask what that means.

627
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:35,012
希拉
Sheila?

628
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,090
我会再结婚吗
Would I get married again?

629
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:40,067
不 我打算一辈子住宿舍 跟别人抢厕所
No. I want to be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding-house, forever.

630
00:49:41,031 --> 00:49:43,046
我当然会再结婚
Of course, I do.

631
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:45,060
为此我每周都去参加那个讨厌的舞会
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.

632
00:49:46,002 --> 00:49:48,055
我想有自己的家
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom.

633
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,079
会有个脾气不怎么好
While some bad-tempered fella,

634
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:53,060
耳毛都露出来的家伙
with hair growing out of his ears

635
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:55,060
坐在马桶上看报纸
reads the newspaper on the toilet.

636
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,066
那时我就会希望我能回到这里 和你聊聊天
And then I'll wish I was back here, talking to you.

637
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:19,073
明天见
I'll catch you tomorrow right?

638
00:50:41,026 --> 00:50:45,026
艾莉丝 抱歉
Eilis! I'm sorry!

639
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:47,018
我以为你不来了
I did not think you were coming.

640
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,011
我猜到你会这么想
I know. I thought you were gonna think that.

641
00:50:49,014 --> 00:50:51,028
所以我无论如何都想赶过来
That's why I wanted to be here. No matter what.

642
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:53,019
我想告诉你
I need to say something...

643
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:55,003
你能不能 咱们能不能先谈点儿别的
Can you... Can we talk about something else ...

644
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:56,084
到了凯赫夫人那儿再说
until we get to Ms. Kehoe?

645
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,056
- 这不是 - 拜托
- It's Not ... - Please?

646
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:06,048
那么 见到你的十分钟之前
So. Ten minutes before I'm supposed meet you ...

647
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:10,015
我还站在从老奶奶的天花板渗出来脚踝深的脏水里
and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.

648
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:14,032
所以 就算你想请我回家喝咖啡
Yes. Even if you were thinking of inviting me in for a coffee.

649
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:16,000
我也得拒绝 为了你好
I would have to say no, for your sake.

650
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,045
所以你怎么在十分钟里修好它的
So how did you fix it in ten minutes?

651
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:21,000
我没有 那十分钟我都在跟老奶奶解释
I didn't. I spent the whole ten minutes explaining to the old lady

652
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:22,078
我得去个地方 然后我再回来
that I had to be somewhere and I'd be back.

653
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,082
她不想放我走
She didn't want to let me go.

654
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:27,052
所以天花板还在渗脏水吗
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?

655
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:32,004
额 六英寸深和一英尺深的脏水也并没啥差别对吧
Oh, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?

656
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:38,048
你让我说我想说的吧 我觉得你不会介意
Let me say what I want to say. I don't think you'll mind.

657
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:40,052
好吧
Okay.

658
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:48,062
还记得吗 在你家吃完晚饭 你告诉我你爱我
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me.

659
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:53,057
我当时不知道该说什么
Well, I didn't really know what to say.

660
00:51:55,061 --> 00:51:57,042
但我现在知道了
But I know what to say now.

661
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:03,094
我考虑过了 我喜欢你
I have thought about you. And I like you,

662
00:52:04,077 --> 00:52:09,081
我喜欢跟你在一起 还有
and I like being with you and ...

663
00:52:11,075 --> 00:52:15,009
也许 我对你也有同样的感觉
Maybe, I feel the same way.

664
00:52:16,073 --> 00:52:19,033
所以下次你再说爱我的时候
So the next time you tell me you love me,

665
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:21,034
如果还有下次
if there is a next time ...

666
00:52:23,036 --> 00:52:25,045
我也会说 我爱你
I'll say I love you too.

667
00:52:29,004 --> 00:52:32,047
-你是认真的吗 -是的
- Are you serious? - Yes.

668
00:52:35,013 --> 00:52:38,071
卧槽 原谅我爆粗口了 但是
Holy shit! Excuse my language, but...

669
00:52:38,093 --> 00:52:42,009
我还以为你要谈别的
I thought we were having a different kind of talk.

670
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:44,056
我可以回家了吧
Can I go home now?

671
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:46,087
-你爱我吗 -是的
- You love Me? - Yes.

672
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,071
但是别再问我其他问题了
But don't ask me anything else,

673
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:51,011
也别提什么咱们的孩子会变成道奇队的粉丝
and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.

674
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:53,030
你是想让孩子喜欢洋基队吗
Oh what? You want kids who like the Yankees?

675
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:55,060
托尼 拜托 别逼我
Tony, please don't push me.

676
00:52:55,063 --> 00:52:57,007
好吧 我道歉
All right. I'm sorry.

677
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,010
亲爱的艾莉丝
Dear Eilis,

678
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,042
非常谢谢你的尼龙袜
Thank you so much for the nylons.

679
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:06,084
巴尔托奇的包装纸让它们看上去格外漂亮
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.

680
00:53:08,007 --> 00:53:11,085
似乎跟这边比起来 任何事物都很新奇 令人兴奋
It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.

681
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:15,080
我迫切地期待 有一天你能带我见识这一切
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.

682
00:53:19,086 --> 00:53:25,011
艾莉丝 你知道我的心与你同在 即使我不在你身边
Oh Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.

683
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:54,004
你真不可思议 我必须这么说
Well. You're marvelous, that's all I have to say.

684
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:57,040
而且在我看来你的考试不止是通过了
And it looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.

685
00:53:58,057 --> 00:54:00,092
你是轻松通过
You, you flew through them.

686
00:54:00,094 --> 00:54:03,099
我已经记不得上次有人来这儿报喜是什么时候了
I can't remember the last time anyone came here with good news.

687
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:06,004
我攒了一些钱
I've saved some money.

688
00:54:06,007 --> 00:54:09,010
交得起下一年的学费 还能还给你上年的
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.

689
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,090
我教区的某个人已经替你交了
One of my parishioners paid.

690
00:54:10,093 --> 00:54:14,052
他需要造福人类 我不会告诉你原因的
He needed to do something for mankind, and I won't tell you why.

691
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:15,067
他自己也还没走出迷林
He is not out of the woods yet, either.

692
00:54:15,071 --> 00:54:17,037
所以他可以为你下一年出学费
so he can cough up for next year, too.

693
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,043
我想知道他被困在什么样的迷林
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.

694
00:54:19,046 --> 00:54:21,049
我知道你想 但不会从我这里知道
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.

695
00:54:23,012 --> 00:54:26,033
学业有成 还告别了单身 艾莉丝
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.

696
00:54:26,036 --> 00:54:29,024
你已经不是去年冬天那个想回家的悲催小姑娘
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.

697
00:54:29,056 --> 00:54:31,068
那些事听上去真遥远
Seems like years ago.

698
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:36,041
我认为这是第一次
Now, I think this is the first time ...

699
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:38,026
住在这儿的姑娘们中
any girl of mine

700
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:41,042
有人破天荒通过了考试
has ever passed an exam, while living here.

701
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:46,046
你告诉托尼了吗 艾莉丝
Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?

702
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,028
当然
Of course.

703
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,060
他准备带你出去庆祝吗
And is he taking you out to celebrate?

704
00:54:48,062 --> 00:54:50,059
我们周末会去科尼岛
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.

705
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:53,030
-天哪   -怎么了
- Oh, boy! - What does that mean?

706
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,086
你有没有泳衣
Do you have a bathing costume?

707
00:54:54,088 --> 00:54:57,012
- 没有 我准备去买... - 你有太阳镜吗
- No, I was going to get one... - Do you have sunglasses?

708
00:54:57,014 --> 00:54:58,097
- 没有 - 你需要太阳镜
- No. - You need sunglasses.

709
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:00,024
我听说今年 如果你在沙滩上不戴着它
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year

710
00:55:00,028 --> 00:55:02,000
人们就会说闲话
people will talk about you.

711
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:05,035
他们会说什么啊 希拉
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?

712
00:55:05,037 --> 00:55:07,003
这才是重点 凯赫夫人
That's the thing, Mrs. Kehoe.

713
00:55:07,006 --> 00:55:09,095
你永远不会知道 因为他们并不当着你的面说
You'd never know, because they'd never say it to your face.

714
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,036
哦上帝啊
Oh, dear God!

715
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:17,025
戴安娜说得对 艾莉丝 你应该好好斟酌你的装扮
Diana's right, though, Eilis. You need to think carefully about your costume.

716
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:20,025
托尼第一见你穿这么少 你不会想让他失望的
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you. You don't want to put him off.

717
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:26,095
你下面得剃干净
You'll have to shave down there.

718
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,077
我给你一把管用的剃刀
I'll give you a razor that will do the trick.

719
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:35,082
你的屁屁暂时没问题
You're all right there for the moment.

720
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:38,007
大多数意大利男人都喜欢丰满的体型
And most Italian men appreciate the fuller figure.

721
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,063
但是 夏天你还是要注意点
But watch yourself, over the summer.

722
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,003
你肤色白皙 黑色对你来说太暗了
The black's too dark for your pale skin.

723
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:45,010
咱们来试试绿色
Let's see you in the green.

724
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:12,047
看那边
Look at that thing.

725
00:56:25,068 --> 00:56:28,080
你怎么不告诉我要把泳衣穿在衣服里面
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?

726
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,043
我以为你知道
I thought you'd know.

727
00:56:32,086 --> 00:56:34,040
好了
Right, I'm ready.

728
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:45,000
- 托尼 - 咋啦
- Tony! - What?

729
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,049
过来
Come on.

730
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:51,051
亲爱的露丝 感谢你的来信
Dear Rose, Thanks for your letter.

731
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:54,034
听到你高尔夫锦标赛的消息我很高兴
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.

732
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,004
你肯定高兴坏了
You must have been really pleased.

733
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,092
我依然思念你和妈妈
I still miss you and mother,

734
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:00,074
我每天都在想你
and I think about you every day.

735
00:57:00,076 --> 00:57:04,027
然而我觉得 这是自我来到美国之后第一次感受到
But I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America,

736
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,027
真正的幸福
I'm really happy.

737
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,027
这大部分要归功于托尼
This is a lot to do with Tony.

738
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:12,000
周末他带我去看了布鲁克林道奇队的比赛
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers,

739
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,003
他热爱的棒球队
the baseball team he loves.

740
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,087
他们输了 这让他很生气
They lost, so he was annoyed.

741
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,090
我也开始在找文职工作
But I've also started to look for office work, too.

742
00:57:19,092 --> 00:57:21,019
这周我去面试了
I had an interview this week ...

743
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:23,029
在布鲁克林的一家纺织品公司
at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.

744
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,002
露丝
Rose?

745
00:57:25,004 --> 00:57:28,046
谁能想到 在一家会出两个簿记员呢
Who'd have thought that there would be two book-keepers in the family?

746
00:57:28,086 --> 00:57:30,015
露丝
Rose?

747
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,051
我很快就能攒够钱回家看你和妈妈
I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and mummy.

748
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:41,021
露丝
Rose!

749
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:47,075
露丝 上帝啊
Rose? Oh my God!

750
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,037
上帝啊
Oh God!

751
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:51,030
露丝
Rose?

752
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:52,098
不
Oh no!

753
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:11,049
稍等
A moment.

754
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:38,017
太突然了 我想她可能是生病了
It was sudden. I think perhaps she was ill,

755
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,060
她自己知道 但她没有告诉任何人
and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.

756
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:48,007
会发生什么
What will happen?

757
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,073
能发生什么呢
What can happen?

758
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:54,043
-她什么时候下葬 -明天
- When will they bury her? - Tomorrow.

759
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:59,008
-不等我吗   -不等
- Without me. - Without you.

760
00:59:00,016 --> 00:59:02,005
你离得太远了 艾莉丝
You're too far away, Eilis.

761
00:59:07,022 --> 00:59:09,013
我到底为什么来这里呢
Why did I ever come here?

762
00:59:10,003 --> 00:59:12,046
露丝希望你能过得更好
Rose wanted a better life for you.

763
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,034
她很欣慰你做得这么优秀
She loved how well you were doing.

764
00:59:14,036 --> 00:59:16,034
但我再也见不到她了
But I will never see her again.

765
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,072
是这样吗 神父 我再也见不到她了
That's right, isn't it, Father? I will never see her again.

766
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,047
你知道的 我相信你们会再见的
You know that I think you will.

767
00:59:27,062 --> 00:59:30,079
她会一直守护着你 在你余生的每一天
And she will be watching over you, every day, for the rest of your life.

768
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:00,083
喂 妈妈
Hello? Mommy?

769
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:05,008
能听见我说话吗 喂
Can you hear me now? Hello?

770
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,043
听不太清
I can't really hear you.

771
01:00:08,096 --> 01:00:11,050
无论如何 葬礼上没有下雨
Well, the rain held off, anyway.

772
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:16,045
她的高尔夫俱乐部成员都来了 每一个人
And the whole of her golf club came. Every single one of them.

773
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:19,064
把屋子都挤满了
We had a real houseful afterwards.

774
01:00:22,091 --> 01:00:24,049
你还在听吗
Are you still there?

775
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:26,086
在
Yes.

776
01:00:29,086 --> 01:00:31,070
人们都很爱她 艾莉丝
People really loved her, Eilis.

777
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:35,040
同事 邻居 每一个人
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.

778
01:00:38,078 --> 01:00:40,040
没人知道该对我说什么
Nobody knew what to say to me.

779
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:48,022
你爸爸去世时 我告诉自己 我不能太过悲痛
When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much

780
01:00:48,022 --> 01:00:49,057
因为我还有你们两个
because I had the two of you.

781
01:00:51,003 --> 01:00:53,046
你去美国的时候 我也这么跟自己说
Then when you went to America, I told myself the same thing

782
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,012
因为她还在这儿陪着我
because she was here with me.

783
01:00:55,086 --> 01:00:58,039
但你们都走了 艾莉丝 没人在我身边了
But everyone's gone, Eilis. I have nobody.

784
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,003
我受不了了 托尼
I can't bear it, Tony.

785
01:01:26,076 --> 01:01:31,099
你是不是想回家了
You wanna go home, I guess.

786
01:01:35,016 --> 01:01:37,084
如果我回去了 你怎么办
And how would it be for you, if I did go home?

787
01:01:38,044 --> 01:01:42,022
我会每天担惊受怕
I'll be afraid, every single day.

788
01:01:42,082 --> 01:01:49,023
- 你担心我不回来吗 - 是的 家毕竟是家
- Afraid that I wouldn't come back? - Yes. Home is home.

789
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,041
我不确定我还有没有家了
I'm not sure if I have a home anymore.

790
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:05,018
你明天不去上班 是吧
You are not going to work tomorrow, are you?

791
01:02:06,088 --> 01:02:09,083
做完弥撒后 我能带你去个地方吗
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?

792
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:23,089
就是这里了
This is it.

793
01:02:25,043 --> 01:02:28,062
如果可以的话 我们在这里盖上五间房子
We're gonna build five houses here, if we can.

794
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:31,011
爸妈会拥有其中一间
And mom and dad, they are gonna have one,

795
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:33,057
因为我妈总是想要一间带后院的房子
Cos ma always wanted a house with a backyard.

796
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:38,015
把其中的三个卖掉 剩下那一个
We'll sell three. And the other one...

797
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:43,023
我兄弟们问我想不想要 我说是的
My brothers they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.

798
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:46,064
所以 我觉得我想说的是
So, I guess what I'm saying is

799
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:48,068
你想和我一起在长岛这里生活吗
if you want to live out here on Long Island?

800
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:51,062
我知道现在这儿看上去并不是太好
I mean I know it doesn't look like much right now,

801
01:02:51,064 --> 01:02:53,040
但是周边其他的地都已经卖光了
but all the land around here has been sold,

802
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:55,094
所以我们不会孤独
so we wouldn't be on our own.

803
01:02:55,097 --> 01:02:59,066
会架电话线 通电 什么都有
And there would be telephone cables, electricity and everything.

804
01:03:07,026 --> 01:03:09,072
我们会创办一个公司
We're gonna set up a company,

805
01:03:09,094 --> 01:03:12,054
一个建筑公司 我们三个
a building company, the three of us.

806
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:17,019
我负责管道 劳伦斯做木工
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and  Lawrence is gonna do the carpentry.

807
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:26,020
别不说话
Don't go all quiet on me.

808
01:03:27,026 --> 01:03:29,023
至少告诉我你会考虑考虑
At least tell me you'll think about it.

809
01:03:33,088 --> 01:03:36,002
我不需要考虑
I don't need to think about it.

810
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:33,048
就回去一个多月 这样会让她好过一点
It's just for a month or so. I know it would make her feel a little better.

811
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:45,003
你愿意在走之前嫁给我吗
Will you marry me before you leave?

812
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,060
你不相信我会回来吗
You don't trust me to come back?

813
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:57,061
嫁给我 嫁给我吧
Marry me! Marry me!

814
01:04:58,092 --> 01:05:00,093
我们不需要告诉任何人
We don't have to tell anyone.

815
01:05:00,095 --> 01:05:04,061
我们赶紧结了 就我俩知道
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.

816
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,018
你为什么想要这样做呢
Why do you want to do it?

817
01:05:10,068 --> 01:05:13,069
因为不这样的话 我会疯掉的
Because if we don't, I am gonna go crazy.

818
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,093
我现在发誓不也一样吗
Would a promise not be the same?

819
01:05:24,062 --> 01:05:28,035
如果你可以发誓的话 结婚对你也不难
If you can promise, you can easily do this.

820
01:06:12,022 --> 01:06:16,008
所以就是这里吗 这就是你住的地方吗
So this is it? This is where you live?

821
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:20,011
是的 如果你弄出一点噪音 她会把我赶出去的
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise she'll evict me.

822
01:07:39,025 --> 01:07:41,047
天哪 天哪
Oh, man! Oh, man!

823
01:07:53,044 --> 01:07:59,013
现在没必要担心了 待在我身边
Oh, there's no point in worrying now. Stay with me.

824
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:32,074
-你想玩吗 -当然
- Do you want to play? - Yes, sure.

825
01:08:32,076 --> 01:08:35,071
好的 球棒马上就好
Alright. Here we go, one bat coming up.

826
01:08:36,088 --> 01:08:39,023
球给我 准备好了吗 手抬起来
I'll take that, alright. You ready? Hands up.

827
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:43,095
哇 直接打到三垒底线
Oh, right down to the third-base line.

828
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:45,076
他是不是打扰到你了 因为连我都觉得他吵
Is he annoying you? Because he is annoying me.

829
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:50,009
没有没有 我有个弟弟跟他一样大 你是爱尔兰人吗
No no no. I got a brother the exact same age? Hey, are you Irish?

830
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,038
有这么明显吗
Is it so obvious?

831
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:53,049
我只是马上要跟一个爱尔兰的姑娘结婚了
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl,

832
01:08:53,053 --> 01:08:54,086
所以我更容易注意到
so I guess I notice it more.

833
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:56,056
布鲁克林有好多爱尔兰人啊
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.

834
01:08:56,059 --> 01:08:58,093
有时候我觉得好像爱尔兰都没人了
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.

835
01:08:58,095 --> 01:09:00,012
你的未婚妻是爱尔兰哪里的
Where is your girl from?

836
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:02,026
恩尼斯科西 在威克斯福德郡
Enniscorthy, in County Wexford.

837
01:09:02,028 --> 01:09:03,053

I think my wife has family there.

838
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,095
嗨 艾莉丝 过来一下

Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.

840
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:25,005
将来我们会告诉孩子们我们是秘密结婚的吗
Will we ever tell our children we did this?

841
01:09:26,068 --> 01:09:29,013
可以留到某个纪念日上说
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.

842
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:32,086
不知道他们会怎么想
I wonder what they'll think of it.

843
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:00,021

不是吧
No!

848
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,005
我早知道了 但我希望南希能亲口告诉你
I knew. But I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.

849
01:10:14,008 --> 01:10:17,013
-我好高兴你能来参加我的婚礼 -我能吗

853

安妮特也想见你

I'll have to find you a key.

856
01:10:29,076 --> 01:10:31,024
我可不想起来给你开门
I don't want you getting me out of bed.

857
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:34,016
我们都很想听听纽约生活是什么样子

我会尽量想出点东西来跟你们分享的

01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:30,072
我不敢相信 你永远没办法认识我丈夫了
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.

862
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:40,078
你一定会喜欢他的 我相信
But you'd like him. I know you would.

863
01:11:44,018 --> 01:11:47,098
他很贴心 很幽默
He's sweet. He's funny.

864
01:11:49,026 --> 01:11:51,098
而且他的眼睛非常美
And he has got these wonderful eyes that…

865
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:06,045
我好希望事情不是现在这样
I wish everything were different…

866
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:29,017
现在轮到 来自库什的奥图尔太太
So, now. Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.

867
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,056
我们必须要回信吗
Do we really have to do this?

868
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:34,011
收到一封吊唁信跟收到生日礼物不一样吧
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?

869
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:36,037
如果这位来自库什的奥图尔太太给你回信
What if Mrs. O'Toole from Cush writes back

870
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:37,093
来感谢你的感谢信呢
To thank you for your thank you?

871
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:39,040
那我就再回一封感谢信
Then I'll thank her.

872
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:41,067
你也愿意后半生都这样寄信收信吗
And you'll be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?

873
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,044
反正我也没别的事情可做
It's not as if I have anything else to do.

874
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:44,097
也没有别的人可以说话
Nor anybody else to talk to.

875
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,016
就和来自库什的奥图尔太太写写信呗
It might as well be Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.

876
01:12:49,012 --> 01:12:50,045
那你想让我写什么
What do you want me to say?

877
01:12:52,013 --> 01:12:54,001
应该是南希和安妮特到了
That would be Nancy and Annette.

878
01:12:55,016 --> 01:12:56,029
去吧
Off you go.

879
01:12:59,068 --> 01:13:01,010
好好玩
Enjoy yourself.

880
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:19,091
艾莉丝 这是吉姆·法瑞尔
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.

881
01:13:21,006 --> 01:13:22,079
很高兴认识你
It's a great pleasure to meet you.

882
01:13:26,076 --> 01:13:28,074
我们可以去康诺特酒店的酒吧
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.

883
01:13:28,077 --> 01:13:31,013
可能橄榄球俱乐部的几个伙计会在那
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.

884
01:13:31,015 --> 01:13:32,020
好的
Okay.

885
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:37,000
你们就天天跟橄榄球俱乐部的那帮人待在一起吗
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?

886
01:13:37,097 --> 01:13:43,006
也不是 只是南希不允许我们跟你讲话
No. But Nancy told us that we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you.

887
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:44,086
因为你们之间有太多话要说了
Because you have too much to say to each other.

888
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:46,064
所以我们只是去找几个伴罢了
So we're just looking for company.

889
01:13:47,058 --> 01:13:48,073
哦 这样
Oh, well.

890
01:13:48,076 --> 01:13:51,021
你不喜欢橄榄球俱乐部的那帮人吗 艾莉丝
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?

891
01:13:51,024 --> 01:13:52,076
我不太喜欢他们 乔治
I don't particularly, George.

892
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:54,039
我刚到美国的时候
When I first went to America,

893
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:57,083
恩尼斯科西的任何东西我都很想念 除了他们
I missed everything about Enniscorthy, except one.

894
01:13:57,086 --> 01:13:59,057
我们也不是全都一样的
We are not all the same.

895
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:03,045
你们看起来都一样 穿着运动夹克 抹着发油
You all look the same. It's the blazer and the hair-oil.

896
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:18,088
南希 安妮特怎么没来 还有他怎么来了
Nancy, where is Annette? And why has he come?

897
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,071
他人很好的 别对他太刻薄了
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.

898
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:25,000
这是跟凯特琳·卡西迪订婚的那个吉姆·法瑞尔吗
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?

899
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,029
发生了什么
What happened to her?

900
01:14:26,031 --> 01:14:28,090
是他提了分手 吉姆觉得她并不是真正爱他
He broke it off. He didn’t think she was serious about him.

901
01:14:28,092 --> 01:14:31,081
他难过了好一阵儿 不过现在都过去了
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.

902
01:14:32,084 --> 01:14:36,000
南希 我是要回美国的
Nancy, I'm going back.

903
01:14:36,003 --> 01:14:38,067
但是你在这儿的时候可以找点乐子嘛 不是吗
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?

904
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:41,023
走吧乔治
Come on George.

905
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:45,091
你母亲还好吗
How is your mother?

906
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,078
她很伤心 最近老得很快
Well, she's sad. And she's got much older very quickly.

907
01:14:54,017 --> 01:14:55,051
那件事太糟了
It was a terrible thing.

908
01:14:55,093 --> 01:14:59,007
我们都去参加葬礼的弥撒了 我父母和我
We all went to the funeral mass. My mother and my father and myself.

909
01:15:00,006 --> 01:15:01,037
我之前不知道呢
I did not know that.

910
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:04,086
我母亲跟你姐姐一起打高尔夫 她很喜欢你姐姐
My mother played golf with her, you know. she is very fond of her.

911
01:15:05,058 --> 01:15:10,065
你姐姐的死是我记忆中这镇上发生的最悲伤的事情
It was the saddest thing that happened in the town that I can remember.

912
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:17,005
-谢谢你 -你们俩快来啊
- Thank you. - Come on you two.

913
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:26,006
-那些摩天大楼怎么样 -那是曼哈顿
- What about the skyscrapers? - But that is Manhattan.

914
01:15:26,008 --> 01:15:29,096
我住在布鲁克林 我的工作在布鲁克林 如果我出去玩 也在布鲁克林
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn. And if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.

915
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:32,036
所有的摩天大楼都在河对面
All the skyscrapers are across the river.

916
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:35,086
-你在美国的生活听起来并不是很光鲜啊    -因为它的确不是
- You don't make it sound very glamorous. - It's not, really.

917
01:15:35,089 --> 01:15:37,012
连那个 唉你叫它什么来着
Not even… What do you call it?

918
01:15:37,015 --> 01:15:38,054
你工作的那个百货
The department store where you work?

919
01:15:38,056 --> 01:15:41,020
巴尔托奇百货 店里卖的东西都很好
Oh, Bartocci's? Well, it sells lovely things,

920
01:15:41,022 --> 01:15:43,012
不过大部分我都买不起
but I can't afford many of them ...

921
01:15:43,014 --> 01:15:44,039
而且我也不是很喜欢那份工作
and I don't like the works.

922
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,075
那你想做什么
What would you like to do?

923
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,033
我想做露丝之前的工作
I want to do what Rose did.

924
01:15:49,036 --> 01:15:51,067
我想在办公室里跟数字打交道
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.

925
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,038
你应该去戴维斯那问问
You should call in at Davis's.

926
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:55,093
他们还没能找到接露丝班的人
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.

927
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:58,014
婚礼一结束我就会回纽约了
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.

928
01:15:58,017 --> 01:16:00,087
但走之前你应该也想要挣点钱吧
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.

929
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,028
我相信你去上班他们一定会很高兴的
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.

930
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,091
少来 你只是想让艾莉丝留下来
Oh, you just want her to stay.

931
01:16:07,054 --> 01:16:09,011
我只是在替艾莉丝着想
I am only thinking of Eilis.

932
01:16:09,013 --> 01:16:11,078
你听到了吗艾莉丝 他想着你呢
Did you hear that Eilis? He's only thinking of you.

933
01:16:20,012 --> 01:16:21,029
就是这里
That's it, that's it...

934
01:16:28,098 --> 01:16:30,009
-晚安    -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

935
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,030
-再见 -再见
- See you. - See you.

936
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:32,050
再见
Bye.

937
01:16:50,024 --> 01:16:54,016
-你今晚过得怎么样    -挺不错的 谢谢
- How's your evening? - It's very nice, thank you.

938
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:56,081
车里那个跟他们一起的是吉姆·法瑞尔吗
Was that Jim Farrell I saw on the car with them?

939
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,016
是的
It was.

940
01:16:59,018 --> 01:17:01,047
你知道吗 他的父母要搬到乡下养老去了
His parents are moving, you know. They're retiring to the country.

941
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:03,040
他会一个人住在镇子上的大房子里
He'll be in that big house on his own.

942
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:04,094
是吗
Is that right?

943
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:08,056
对某些人来说 他条件挺不错的
It's a catch for "someone".

944
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:12,042
妈妈 晚安
Goodnight Mommy.

945
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:26,038
-嗨 艾莉丝 - 嗨 布伦南太太
- Hello Eilis. - Hello Ms. Brennan..

946
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:28,032
我喜欢她的打扮
I like her style.

947
01:17:35,095 --> 01:17:38,010
-谢天谢地你终于回来了 -发生什么事了
- Thank Goodness you're back! - What's the matter?

948
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:39,077
戴维斯那的一个伙计刚刚来了
A lad from Davis's came round.

949
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,012
他们会计部门有点困难
They have a problem in their accounts department

950
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:43,013
-想让你马上过去 -就这样吗
- And they need you up there straight away. - Is that all?

951
01:17:43,015 --> 01:17:45,061
-那我先把买来的东西放起来 -不不不 我来
- I'll just put the shopping away. - No, no, leave it.

952
01:17:45,064 --> 01:17:47,023
那小伙子说的是 马上
“Straight away”, the young fella said.

953
01:17:47,025 --> 01:17:50,006
他说什么不重要 母亲 我又不是那里的职员
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother. I'm not an employee.

954
01:17:50,008 --> 01:17:51,025
我要去也只是帮个忙
I'd be doing them a favour.

955
01:17:51,028 --> 01:17:53,028
你就让我来放这些行吗
Please let me do the shopping.

956
01:18:02,017 --> 01:18:04,040
麻烦的是 现在是我们的忙季
The problem is that it's our busy season,

957
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:07,070
所有的中层工人和司机上周都在加班
so all the middle workers and drivers did overtime last week.

958
01:18:07,073 --> 01:18:10,066
他们已经把加班的单子填好了
Well, they filled out the overtime slips

959
01:18:10,076 --> 01:18:12,050
但是还没人能算出来加班费
but there's been nobody to work it all out,

960
01:18:12,057 --> 01:18:13,093
加到他们的工资单
to add to the wage slips.

961
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:15,078
有些人已经开始抱怨这事了
And some of the men have started to complain.

962
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:17,044
我也不怪他们
And I can't blame them.

963
01:18:17,046 --> 01:18:20,012
就像你看到的一样 这儿一团糟
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.

964
01:18:23,033 --> 01:18:26,061
这样 你给我几个小时 我能整理出一个系统来
Well. If you leave me for a couple of hours, I can work out a system

965
01:18:26,064 --> 01:18:29,020
这样不管是谁来接我的班都不会有任何问题
so that whoever comes in after me won't have any trouble.

966
01:18:39,054 --> 01:18:40,096
你好 艾莉丝
Hello, Eilis.

967
01:18:40,098 --> 01:18:43,074
玛利亚一直在跟我讲你的工作有多么的出色
Maria has been telling me you have done the most marvellous job here.

968
01:18:43,077 --> 01:18:45,002
谢谢
Thank you.

969
01:18:45,004 --> 01:18:46,025
我们理应早就知道你的
We should have known you would, of course.

970
01:18:46,027 --> 01:18:48,005
毕竟你是露丝的妹妹
You're Rose's sister, after all.

971
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:50,027
有人告诉我你有会计证书是吗
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping?

972
01:18:50,028 --> 01:18:51,082
是美国的会计证书吗
Is it in American book-keeping?

973
01:18:51,082 --> 01:18:53,046
我是在美国拿的证书
I got the certificate in America,

974
01:18:53,048 --> 01:18:55,018
但是这两个体系是非常相似的
but the two systems are very similar.

975
01:18:55,090 --> 01:19:00,023
我们在忙季确实需要找会计处理工资和其他事务的
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.

976
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:03,036
我希望你能继续在这里兼职
so I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.

977
01:19:03,036 --> 01:19:05,056
我们可以看看情况 之后我们再谈
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.

978
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:08,002
我不久以后就会回美国了
I'll be going back to the United States soon.

979
01:19:08,002 --> 01:19:10,038
我说了 在我们彼此都做了最后决定之前
As I said. Lets you and I speak again before we make

980
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:12,069
我们可以再谈一次
any firm decisions one way or the other.

981
01:19:14,095 --> 01:19:17,073
好的 一定 布朗先生 谢谢
Yes, Mr. Brown. Of course. Thank you.

982
01:19:18,035 --> 01:19:20,093
你现在可以去找玛利亚拿你今天的工资了
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.

983
01:20:24,007 --> 01:20:26,078
-我都要忘记了 -忘记什么
- I'd forgotten. - What?

984
01:20:28,006 --> 01:20:29,039
眼前的景色
This…

985
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:33,019
布鲁克林有海滩吗
You have beaches in Brooklyn?

986
01:20:34,017 --> 01:20:36,074
有 但海滩上有很多人
Yes, but they are just very crowded.

987
01:20:37,027 --> 01:20:40,019
过一会儿这里也会有挺多散步的人的
There will probably be quite a few walkers along here later.

988
01:20:41,057 --> 01:20:44,078
是吧 不过还是不一样
Yes. It's still not the same.

989
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:48,000
那确实
I'm sure it's not.

990
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:52,060
我们不太知道除了这里其他地方都发生了什么事
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.

991
01:20:54,024 --> 01:20:56,050
你现在肯定觉得我们很闭塞吧
We must seem very backward to you now.

992
01:20:56,082 --> 01:21:01,066
当然没有 你是个很冷静很有教养的人 很有魅力
Of course not. You seem calm, and civilised. And charming.

993
01:21:08,022 --> 01:21:09,045
快来呀
Come on!

994
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,063
我母亲想让你知道 她们的高尔夫俱乐部
My mother wanted you to know that the golf club…

995
01:21:19,069 --> 01:21:21,086
以露丝的名义设立了一个奖项
is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.

996
01:21:24,085 --> 01:21:28,056
一个给俱乐部的新人设立的最佳得分奖
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the Club.

997
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:32,089
我母亲说 你姐姐总是对新人很友善
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.

998
01:21:36,022 --> 01:21:37,047
我希望这能让你开心
I hope you're pleased.

999
01:21:41,003 --> 01:21:44,033
当然
Yes, of course.

1000
01:21:46,088 --> 01:21:52,048
所以说 每一年会有人得到一个露丝·蕾西奖
So, every year, someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?

1001
01:21:53,054 --> 01:21:56,088
每年都有 只要高尔夫俱乐部还存在
Every year. As long as there's a golf club.

1002
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:07,050
她希望第一届你能去给获奖者颁奖
And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.

1003
01:22:11,084 --> 01:22:14,027
对了 我母亲也想顺便见见你
Yeah and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.

1004
01:22:16,049 --> 01:22:18,071
我会安排一个时间请你来喝茶
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.

1005
01:22:20,089 --> 01:22:22,085
谢谢你 我会去的
Thank you, I'd like that.

1006
01:22:28,057 --> 01:22:30,084
要是我走之前就能像现在这样就好了
I wish it had been like this before I went.

1007
01:22:31,096 --> 01:22:35,072
-露丝死之前   -像什么样
- Before Rose died. - Like what?

1008
01:22:37,034 --> 01:22:41,033
之前我什么都没有 而现在 我有了一份工作 还...
There was nothing here for me here before. And now I have a job, and…

1009
01:22:42,051 --> 01:22:43,051
这里行吗
Here?

1010
01:22:58,075 --> 01:23:02,007
-这是美国人的方法吗    -是的 不错呢 是吧
- Is that an American trick? - Yes. It’s a good one, isn’t it?

1011
01:23:04,027 --> 01:23:07,017
这让人挺郁闷的 我们怎么就想不出这样的方法呢
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?

1012
01:23:07,068 --> 01:23:10,017
我是说 他们多久前就想到了
I mean how long have they known about it?

1013
01:23:10,049 --> 01:23:12,025
说不定都一百年了
A hundred years, probably.

1014
01:23:12,027 --> 01:23:15,020
我觉得一百年前他们应该还没有这样的泳衣吧
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.

1015
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,070
可我们现在都还没有呢
And we still don't have them now.

1016
01:23:21,098 --> 01:23:23,032
唉 来吧
Well, come on.

1017
01:23:31,051 --> 01:23:33,063
你周六想去看道奇队的球赛吗
You want to go see the Dodgers on Saturday?

1018
01:23:33,066 --> 01:23:34,075
当然了
Sure.

1019
01:23:34,078 --> 01:23:36,085
行 那你帮我做件事行吗
Okay, will you do something for me?

1020
01:23:37,018 --> 01:23:38,026
什么事
What?

1021
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:42,022
如果你嘲笑我 或者跟家里任何一个人说起这件事
If you laugh, or you say anything about this to anybody in the family,

1022
01:23:42,025 --> 01:23:44,039
周六的比赛你就没得看了
you don't get to see the Dodgers on Saturday.

1023
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:46,011
这赛季任何一场球你都看不了了
Or any other day of the season.

1024
01:23:46,013 --> 01:23:47,028
而且 我还会打你一顿
Also, you get a beating.

1025
01:23:47,031 --> 01:23:49,077
那我还是不掺合比较好
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.

1026
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:52,021
弗兰基 我真的很需要你帮忙
I really need your help Frankie.

1027
01:23:52,024 --> 01:23:54,020
你知道你是这个家里读写能力最好的人
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?

1028
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:59,058
我试着给艾莉丝写信 我也说不清该怎么写
I'm trying to write to Eilis, and I want it to be, I don't know ...

1029
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:02,032
你之前不是写过了吗 大概五封信
You wrote before already. About five times.

1030
01:24:02,035 --> 01:24:05,009
是的 弗兰基 但是它们都不够好
Yeah, but they are no good Frankie and ...

1031
01:24:07,067 --> 01:24:09,077
而且她只回过一次信
And she's only written back once.

1032
01:24:10,019 --> 01:24:13,099
她之前从未读过我写的东西 我怕她看了会嫌弃我
She's never read my writing before. I'm worried I'm putting her off me.

1033
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:19,011
听着 我才八岁 我才不懂你们亲亲的事
Listen, I'm eight years old, I don't know anything about kissing.

1034
01:24:19,014 --> 01:24:21,030
你不需要知道这些事情
You don't need to know anything about kissing.

1035
01:24:21,042 --> 01:24:25,002
你只需知道拼写 还有
You need to know about spelling and...and...

1036
01:24:25,004 --> 01:24:28,046
-语法吗 -没错 你帮不帮我看
- Grammar? - Yeah, Will you look?

1037
01:24:36,068 --> 01:24:41,040
亲爱的艾莉丝 我希望你在爱尔兰一切安好
Dear Eilis, I hope that you're doing well in Ireland.

1038
01:24:41,043 --> 01:24:44,026
我希望你的母亲没那么伤心了
I hope that your mother is feeling less sad.

1039
01:24:45,078 --> 01:24:50,073
你的朋友很快就会完婚 你就能回到这里了
It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.

1040
01:24:53,071 --> 01:24:57,019
这一周好像全世界的地下室都发了大水
This week it is like the whole world's basements are flooding.

1041
01:24:57,021 --> 01:25:03,051
我修了三家 我一直在努力工作攒钱
I fixed three. I've been working hard. I've been saving money.

1042
01:25:04,022 --> 01:25:06,052
大家都时常向我问起你
Everybody asks me about you all the time.

1043
01:25:06,094 --> 01:25:11,049
你单词拼错了 少了一个E
You missed out the "e" I think. It is "everybody."

1044
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,094
这大概就是我所有的新鲜事了吧
Anyway, I think that is all my news.

1045
01:25:15,097 --> 01:25:19,039
我的父母还有兄弟们都问你好
Mom and dad and all my brothers they all say hello.

1046
01:25:20,046 --> 01:25:23,048
我每时每刻都在思念着你
I think about you most minutes of most days.

1047
01:25:25,005 --> 01:25:27,071
甚至当我在看道奇队的比赛时
Even when I go see the Dodgers.

1048
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:29,086
我心思都不在球赛上
I do not concentrate on the game.

1049
01:25:31,033 --> 01:25:33,087
爱你的托尼
With love, your Tony.

1050
01:26:32,032 --> 01:26:33,070
你没有上发油
No hair oil.

1051
01:26:34,048 --> 01:26:36,072
还有这不是休闲外套 这是运动夹克
And that's not a blazer, it's a sports jacket.

1052
01:26:36,075 --> 01:26:38,078
吉姆·法瑞尔 你是不是穿上了伪装
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?

1053
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,096
你是想诱骗我吗
Are you trying to trick me?

1054
01:26:42,006 --> 01:26:45,093
当你说我们那群人是一路货色的时候 我明白你的意思
I knew what you meant, when you said we're all the same.

1055
01:26:47,003 --> 01:26:50,008
或许在你看来 我生活地非常容易
It made me think that my life must seem very east to you.

1056
01:26:50,011 --> 01:26:53,031
接管父亲的酒吧 住在父母的房子里
I run my father's bar, going to live in my parents' house.

1057
01:26:54,054 --> 01:26:56,016
我能想象到外人是怎么看待这一切的
I know what that must look like from the outside

1058
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:00,017
但其实并不是那样
But it doesn't feel like that.

1059
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:03,046
那是什么样的
What does it feel like?

1060
01:27:07,052 --> 01:27:08,092
我从没去过任何地方
I've never been anywhere.

1061
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:10,096
我甚至都没到过英格兰
I have never even been to England.

1062
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:15,092
我想去看看 伦敦 巴黎 还有罗马 纽约
But I'd like to see London, and Paris and Rome. New York.

1063
01:27:16,058 --> 01:27:20,044
一想到我这辈子可能都踏不出爱尔兰 就觉得可怕
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.

1064
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:22,012
当然还有些别的事情
And there are other things too ...

1065
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:28,031
抱歉 我想问你很多事 但我却一直在说
I'm so sorry. I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.

1066
01:27:28,053 --> 01:27:29,062
没事 我喜欢听
I am glad.

1067
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:32,043
-真的吗   -真的
- Really? - Yes.

1068
01:27:35,029 --> 01:27:37,078
你能快点抽完你那破烟 然后过来坐下吗
Will you finsh that wretched pipe and sit with us?

1069
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,068
我在这儿也听得一清二楚
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.

1070
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,067
我们可不是来给你提供娱乐节目的
We are not here to provide you with entertainment.

1071
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:44,015
别担心 很多年前我就明白这个道理了
Oh, don't you worry. I found that out many years ago.

1072
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:48,046
艾莉丝 你别理他 反正吉姆像我 不随他
Just ignore him, Eilis. It's as well Jim takes after me, but him.

1073
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:49,054
你大声点
Speak up!

1074
01:27:49,086 --> 01:27:52,008
你们期待搬家吗
Are you looking forward to your move?

1075
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,056
我会想念恩尼斯科西的 但是格伦布里恩是个美丽安宁的地方
Ah, I will miss Enniscorthy. But it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.

1076
01:27:54,088 --> 01:27:57,046
我妈担心我一个人在这
My mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.

1077
01:27:57,049 --> 01:27:59,028
她怕我会毁了这地方
She thinks I'll destroy the place.

1078
01:27:59,031 --> 01:28:00,093
我希望你不要单身一辈子
I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.

1079
01:28:01,005 --> 01:28:02,037
我相信他不会的
I'm sure he won't.

1080
01:28:03,058 --> 01:28:04,088
我的意思是
I mean...

1081
01:28:08,002 --> 01:28:10,064
-今天天气真好不是吗    -是个好天气
- God, aren't we blessed with this weather. - It's lovely.

1082
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:30,086
亲爱的托尼 感谢你的来信
Dear Tony, thank you for your letters.

1083
01:28:32,003 --> 01:28:33,055
我想要你知道
I want you to know that...

1084
01:28:37,056 --> 01:28:39,007
我不知道我想跟你说啥
I don't know what I want you to know.

1085
01:28:53,002 --> 01:28:54,067
我不想坐在很后面的位置
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.

1086
01:28:54,069 --> 01:28:57,009
我会确保你们坐在教堂最好的位置
I'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.

1087
01:28:57,032 --> 01:29:00,031
但是坐在南希和乔治边上也很奇怪
Oh, it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.

1088
01:29:01,007 --> 01:29:03,071
那我们就坐在教堂内第二好的位置上
We'll find the second best seats in the house then.

1089
01:29:06,028 --> 01:29:09,060
我先去为你们留个好位置可以吗 蕾西太太
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs. Lacey?

1090
01:29:09,062 --> 01:29:11,075
不麻烦你吗吉姆 那真是太好了
Would you mind Jim? That would be grand.

1091
01:29:15,075 --> 01:29:18,027
-真是一位绅士 不是嘛  -没错
- Such a gentleman, isn't he? - He is.

1092
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:21,072
他在最合适的时间出现在我们身边
He came along at just the right time for us.

1093
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:29,091
南希 我诚邀你在这教堂里宣誓 在上帝的见证下
I invite you now Nancy, to declare before God and his church ...

1094
01:29:29,094 --> 01:29:33,054
成为乔治的妻子
your consent to become George's wife.

1095
01:29:35,013 --> 01:29:40,003
我发誓 无论顺境还是逆境
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad,

1096
01:29:40,006 --> 01:29:44,007
无论疾病还是健康 我都会爱着你
in sickness and in health. I will love you

1097
01:29:44,016 --> 01:29:47,089
尊重你 在我生命的每一天
and honour you all the days of my life.

1098
01:29:48,071 --> 01:29:50,015
拿戒指来
The rings.

1099
01:29:55,095 --> 01:30:01,014
主啊 请赐福这对戒指 戴上这对戒指的新人
Lord, bless these rings, grant that those who wear them

1100
01:30:01,017 --> 01:30:04,046
能永远对彼此忠诚
may always be faithful to each other.

1101
01:30:04,048 --> 01:30:09,066
愿他们遵从神意 和睦相爱
May they do your will and live in peace with you, and mutual love.

1102
01:30:09,098 --> 01:30:13,075
请遵从主的圣意 阿门
We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

1103
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:15,071
阿门
Amen.

1104
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:29,080
艾莉丝 听你妈说 你在这儿过的很好
Your mother tells me things are working out for you very well in Enniscorthy, Eilis.

1105
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,051
婚礼仪式办得很好
It was a lovely service.

1106
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:37,057
听说法瑞尔夫妇就要搬去格伦布里恩 吉姆就...
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien, so Jim will...

1107
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:39,041
是的 我知道
Yes, I know.

1108
01:30:39,043 --> 01:30:42,009
吉姆和我答应要带我妈回车上
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.

1109
01:30:42,011 --> 01:30:47,007
哦 听到了吗 吉姆和我 吉姆和我
Oh, do you hear that? “Jim and I! Jim and I!”.

1110
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:48,080
听你这么说 感觉好事将近了呢
It won't be long now, by the sound of it,

1111
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:51,086
你妈妈一定会很开心
and your mother will have a wonderful day out.

1112
01:30:52,068 --> 01:30:55,049
抱歉 我先走一步
Will you excuse me?

1113
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:05,085
我们能谈一谈吗
Can we talk?

1114
01:31:07,077 --> 01:31:12,028
-关于什么    -关于未来
- What about? - The future.

1115
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:17,018
我不能一句话不说就让你回美国了
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.

1116
01:31:18,097 --> 01:31:21,026
这样的话 我会后悔一辈子的
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

1117
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:27,014
所以我想说 我不想让你走
So, I don't want you to go.

1118
01:31:28,039 --> 01:31:31,041
我想你留在这里 和我在一起
I want you to stay here, with me.

1119
01:31:34,027 --> 01:31:36,099
我知道这意味着 我要问你另外一个问题
And I know that means asking you another question,

1120
01:31:39,013 --> 01:31:40,086
我并不想吓到你
But I don't want to bombard you.

1121
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:44,099
所以我决定迟一些再问你
So I'll save that one for later.

1122
01:31:50,069 --> 01:31:52,002
谢谢你
Thank you.

1123
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:59,097
我很感激 也很受宠若惊
I'm grateful. And I'm flattered.

1124
01:32:02,071 --> 01:32:04,059
-就这些了吗 -不
- That's all? - No.

1125
01:32:06,012 --> 01:32:08,000
当然不是
No, of course not.

1126
01:32:13,086 --> 01:32:15,006
只是
It is just...

1127
01:32:17,092 --> 01:32:20,039
我想象的是完全不同的另一种生活
I'd imagined a different life for myself.

1128
01:32:21,072 --> 01:32:22,089
我理解你
I understand.

1129
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,038
但是你在这的生活 也可以一样好
But your life here could be just as good.

1130
01:32:28,017 --> 01:32:29,096
甚至是更好
Better,even, maybe.

1131
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:12,096
玛丽
Mary!

1132
01:33:13,029 --> 01:33:15,012
我是来请你去一趟的
I was just coming to fetch you.

1133
01:33:15,015 --> 01:33:18,039
为什么要叫我去 我已经不在凯莉夫人那里工作很久了 玛丽
To fetch me? I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.

1134
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:21,060
拜托了 艾莉丝 她说让我不接到你就别回去
Oh, Please come Eilis. She told me not to come back without you.

1135
01:33:21,063 --> 01:33:23,012
你知道她是什么样的人
You know what she's like.

1136
01:33:34,046 --> 01:33:38,021
玛丽 我上楼和艾莉丝谈话的时候你替我照看一下店 就五分钟
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.

1137
01:33:38,024 --> 01:33:39,086
这个时候店里没什么顾客
There are no customers in there at the moment,

1138
01:33:39,088 --> 01:33:42,046
我觉得你应该不会搞得太糟
so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.

1139
01:34:04,025 --> 01:34:06,091
所以 你近来如何呀
So. How have you been getting on?

1140
01:34:08,008 --> 01:34:09,094
谢谢凯莉夫人 一切都很好
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.

1141
01:34:09,096 --> 01:34:12,033
我听说你在戴维斯那工作
I heard that you're working over at Davis's?

1142
01:34:12,037 --> 01:34:14,033
在会计部门
In the accounts department?

1143
01:34:14,045 --> 01:34:16,006
是的
That's right.

1144
01:34:16,009 --> 01:34:19,042
我听到很多关于你和吉姆·法瑞尔的流言蜚语
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.

1145
01:34:19,045 --> 01:34:23,015
你知道人们就热衷于说三道四
Ah, well. You know what people are like. They love to talk.

1146
01:34:23,018 --> 01:34:28,080
这倒是真的 你还记得布雷迪太太吗
Yes. Do you remember Mrs. Brady?

1147
01:34:30,058 --> 01:34:34,016
她以前常在周日早上来店里买些熏肉片
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.

1148
01:34:36,029 --> 01:34:40,097
不记得了吗 看来你现在过的很繁忙啊
No? Well, you have a very busy life now.

1149
01:34:41,019 --> 01:34:42,086
一桩接一桩
What with one thing and another.

1150
01:34:44,019 --> 01:34:49,050
布雷迪太太有个侄女住在布鲁克林
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.

1151
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:55,041
这个世界真小 不是嘛
The world is a small place, isn't it?

1152
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:59,050
她几周前收到她侄女的一封信
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.

1153
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,017
那信上怎么说
And what did it say?

1154
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:08,055
就是说她去市政厅参加别人的婚礼
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall,

1155
01:35:09,024 --> 01:35:15,027
她丈夫无意中撞见一个来自恩尼斯科西的女孩也在那里登记结婚
and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.

1156
01:35:18,065 --> 01:35:20,066
凯莉夫人 我不太懂你到底想表达什么
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.

1157
01:35:20,066 --> 01:35:22,022
他没有撞见我
He didn't bump into me.

1158
01:35:22,025 --> 01:35:25,079
蕾西小姐 你可糊弄不了我
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.

1159
01:35:26,093 --> 01:35:31,029
我都不确定这还是你的姓氏吗
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?

1160
01:35:32,004 --> 01:35:36,094
他已经记不太清了 好像姓是意大利的
He couldn't remember. Something Italian, he thought.

1161
01:35:44,012 --> 01:35:45,061
我忘了
I'd forgotten.

1162
01:35:45,064 --> 01:35:48,069
你居然说你忘了 这真是
You'd forgotten! What a thing for...

1163
01:35:48,069 --> 01:35:50,090
我是说 我忘了这个镇是什么样的了
I'd forgotten what this town is like.

1164
01:35:55,084 --> 01:35:57,095
凯莉夫人 你到底在打什么小主意
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?

1165
01:35:59,068 --> 01:36:01,023
想让我离吉姆远一点吗
Keep me away from Jim?

1166
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:05,037
还是想阻止我回美国
Stop me from going back to America?

1167
01:36:07,092 --> 01:36:09,082
或许你自己都不知道
Perhaps you didn't even know.

1168
01:36:17,028 --> 01:36:21,002
我的名字是艾莉丝·菲欧雷洛
My name is Eilis Fiorello.

1169
01:36:54,091 --> 01:36:58,006
-谢谢 -你好 有什么可以帮您的
- Thank you. - How I can help you?

1170
01:36:58,007 --> 01:37:02,075
你好 我想预订一张最近一班从科夫到纽约的船票
Hello, I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.

1171
01:37:03,037 --> 01:37:06,042
我觉得婚礼后反而更花钱
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.

1172
01:37:06,044 --> 01:37:08,093
南希的妈妈该是把镇上所有店走了遍吧
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.

1173
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,097
她连点火器都买好了
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.

1174
01:37:10,099 --> 01:37:12,060
在八月就买点火器
Firelighters! In August!

1175
01:37:12,062 --> 01:37:14,050
但是她见了斯泰普尔顿太太
But she'd seen Mrs. Stapleton in there,

1176
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:17,065
她还没有机会把婚礼一整天的细节都和她过一遍
and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her, so...

1177
01:37:19,072 --> 01:37:21,026
艾莉丝 你怎么了
Eilis, what's the matter?

1178
01:37:21,029 --> 01:37:23,017
你和吉姆之间发生什么了吗
Has something happened with Jim?

1179
01:37:24,045 --> 01:37:26,009
妈 我很抱歉
Mommy, I'm sorry.

1180
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,017
我非常抱歉 我已经结婚了
I'm so sorry. I'm married.

1181
01:37:33,034 --> 01:37:37,054
我回家之前就在布鲁克林完婚了 我应该告诉你的
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home. I should have told you.

1182
01:37:38,033 --> 01:37:40,059
我应该回来第一时间告诉你
I should have told you as soon as I got back.

1183
01:37:45,086 --> 01:37:51,046
我想和他 和我的丈夫在一起
I want to be with him. I want to be with my husband.

1184
01:37:54,013 --> 01:37:55,066
那是当然
Of course.

1185
01:37:58,064 --> 01:38:00,002
他人好吗
Is he nice?

1186
01:38:02,003 --> 01:38:03,022
很好
Yes.

1187
01:38:03,024 --> 01:38:05,048
你嫁的人一定是很好的
He'd have to be nice, if you married him.

1188
01:38:08,053 --> 01:38:10,011
所以你要回纽约去吗
So you are going back?

1189
01:38:11,074 --> 01:38:14,097
是的 就是明天
Yes. Tomorrow.

1190
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:20,022
你是要坐早班的火车吗
Are you on the early train?

1191
01:38:25,092 --> 01:38:27,055
我要去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

1192
01:38:27,078 --> 01:38:31,054
妈 现在连八点都没到 你不要这样
Mummy...It's not even eight o'clock. You don't have to..

1193
01:38:31,054 --> 01:38:33,000
我很疲倦
I'm very tired.

1194
01:38:34,068 --> 01:38:40,067
我想现在就说再见 只说一次
And I'd like to say goodbye now, and only once.

1195
01:39:14,076 --> 01:39:16,073
或许你能在信里跟我聊聊他
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.

1196
01:39:17,052 --> 01:39:18,057
我会的
I will.

1197
01:39:19,087 --> 01:39:21,043
艾莉丝 晚安
Goodnight Eilis.

1198
01:41:37,077 --> 01:41:39,074
你是要搬去美国吗
So are you away to live in America?

1199
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:44,010
-不是 -去旅游嘛
- No. - Just visiting?

1200
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:46,084
不是 我已经住在那儿了
No. I live there already.

1201
01:41:47,065 --> 01:41:50,010
真的吗 那是什么感觉
Really? What's it like?

1202
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:53,011
那是一个很大很大的地方
It's a big place.

1203
01:41:55,033 --> 01:41:59,054
我准备住在纽约的布鲁克林 你知道那吗
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York. Do you know it?

1204
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:02,094
当然
Yes.

1205
01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:06,099
人们都说 在那里有很多爱尔兰人
People say that there's so many Irish people there.

1206
01:42:07,096 --> 01:42:09,031
就像家一样
It's like home.

1207
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:14,030
这是真的吗
Is that right?

1208
01:42:19,002 --> 01:42:22,066
是真的 就像家一样
Yes, it's just like home.

1209
01:42:35,062 --> 01:42:37,000
你不准吃东西
You're not to eat.

1210
01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:40,003
但是我得在那儿待好久啊
But I might be there years.

1211
01:42:40,036 --> 01:42:42,024
你到美国后就什么都能吃
No, you can eat when you get there.

1212
01:42:42,024 --> 01:42:43,080
但千万别在船上吃东西
Don't eat on the boat.

1213
01:42:43,082 --> 01:42:46,000
这样就不晕船了 你能答应我吗
It'll stop you getting so sick. Do you promise me?

1214
01:42:46,097 --> 01:42:47,071
我答应
I promise.

1215
01:42:47,073 --> 01:42:50,079
过会儿 你马上到你的房间
And in a moment, I want you to go straight down to your cabin

1216
01:42:50,082 --> 01:42:52,050
然后把你这侧的门锁上
and lock the bathroom door on your side.

1217
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:55,091
等隔壁房间开始砸门 你就可以开始谈判
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.

1218
01:42:57,064 --> 01:43:00,054
等你到了海关那儿 睁大你的眼睛
When you get to Immigration, keep your eyes wide open,

1219
01:43:00,054 --> 01:43:02,037
摆出你知道自己要去哪儿的样子
Look as if you know where you're going.

1220
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,069
你必须像美国人一样思考
You have to think like an American.

1221
01:43:04,071 --> 01:43:06,005
麻烦你上前一步
Could you please step forward?

1222
01:43:07,025 --> 01:43:10,044
你会十分想家 想得要命
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die,

1223
01:43:10,066 --> 01:43:13,083
你除了忍受这一切以外毫无办法
and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.

1224
01:43:15,064 --> 01:43:18,061
但是这一切并不会击垮你
But you will, and it won't kill you.

1225
01:43:32,089 --> 01:43:36,013
终有一天 太阳会再次升起
And one day the sun will come out

1226
01:43:36,035 --> 01:43:40,011
你或许都未曾注意到 就这么悄无声息地
and you might not even note it straight away, it would be that faint.

1227
01:43:40,064 --> 01:43:44,033
你会开始思考其它的事情
And then you will catch yourself thinking about something or

1228
01:43:44,035 --> 01:43:47,044
会挂念一个和你过去毫无交集的人
or someone who has no connection with the past,

1229
01:43:49,028 --> 01:43:51,024
一个只属于你的人
Someone who's only yours.

1230
01:43:52,076 --> 01:43:54,057
那时 你就会明白
And you'll realise

1231
01:43:57,005 --> 01:43:59,011
这就是你的安生之地
that this is where your life is.
