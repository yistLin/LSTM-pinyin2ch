Ricky 我是Bella 你可以叫我Bella
Ricky, I'm Bella. Uh, you can call me Bella,

22
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,560
或者你愿意的话叫阿姨也行
or Auntie, if you like,

23
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,600
虽然我不是你亲阿姨
even though I'm not your real auntie.

24
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,540
但是这样更亲近一点儿嘛
But, you know, it's a bit less formal.

25
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,580
哇喔 你可真是个大胖小子
Whoo. You're a big fella!

26
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,450
你是不是把世界上所有的派都吞肚子里了啊 哈哈
Who ate the guy who ate all the pies, eh?

27
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,490
额 不好意思
Sorry.

28
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,670
他挺不错的
Well, he's nice.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,580
是啊 我们现在有点事情
Yeah. Now, uh, obviously we've

30
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,860
需要好好谈谈 Bella
got a couple of things to talk through, Bella.

31
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,940
之前你肯定已经了解过这孩子的
Clearly you've been briefed about his,

32
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,460
背景情况和收养史了
uh, background and also his foster care history.

33
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,130
很显然 他是个真正的小坏蛋 烫手山芋一个
Apparently he's a bit of a handful, a real bad egg.

34
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,530
我是说 如果你看过他的档案 你就会发现
I mean, if you look at his file, you'll see that for yourself.

35
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,670
这小家伙可真是劣迹斑斑 叛逆 偷窃 乱吐痰 逃家
We're talking disobedience, stealing, spitting, running away,

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,760
扔石头 踹东西 毁坏公物
throwing rocks, kicking stuff, defacing stuff,

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,240
放火 涂鸦 成天鬼混
burning stuff, loitering and graffiti.

38
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,150
这还只是我们所知道的而已
And that's just the stuff we know about.

39
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,780
但我们希望 通过环境的改变能让他改邪归正
But hopefully, uh, change in scene will help straighten him out.

40
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,380
现在他有家了 他会好起来的
He's home now. He'll be OK.

41
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,200
我喜欢你的乐观 非常好
OK. Well, I like your enthusiasm. Good.

42
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,970
Ricky 这儿就是你的新家了
Ricky, this is your new home.

43
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,770
这小子可难缠了
A real piece of work, this one.

44
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,340
Ricky
Ricky!

45
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,040
已经没有别的人家愿意收留你了 知道吗
There's no one else who wants you, OK?

46
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,680
好了 Ricky 你知道留给你的另一个选择是什么 是吧
Now, Ricky, you know what the alternative is, don't you? Eh?

47
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,000
- 所以这次你能乖乖合作吗 - 当然可以 我们一定可以搞定的
- Think you can make it work? - Course we can. We'll make it work.

48
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,100
让开点 快点 让开点
Move. Move it. Move!

49
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,870
我已经干这行很久了
Yeah. I've been in this game a long time.

50
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,690
我们的口号是“不放弃任何一个孩子 ”
"No child left behind" Is our motto.

51
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,870
好吧 虽然不是官方口号
Well, it's not, you know, the official motto,

52
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,390
但这绝对是我的想法
but it's definitely mine.

53
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,680
另外 我们还要走个交接程序
Also, as part of the transition process,

54
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,910
我需要检查一下你的财产状况
I'll be needing to inspect your property,

55
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,650
确保你这里的收养环境能符合我们的高标准要求
just to make sure that it's up to our high standard.

56
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,220
看起来还不错 你觉得呢 Tappert警官
Looks fine. What do you think, Constable Tappert?

57
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,460
- Andy - 是啊 挺不错的
Andy! Yeah, it looks cool.

58
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,240
好了 我们大约每两个月会来检查一次
Yeah. We'll be coming in every

59
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,260
看看孩子的情况
eight weeks or so, just to check in on, uh...

60
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,630
<i>[“鳄鱼邓迪”为20世纪80年代年澳大利亚拍摄的一个系列电影 男主是一名鳄鱼猎手 由保罗·霍根饰演]
那个“鳄鱼邓迪”是谁啊
Who's that Crocodile Dundee guy over there?</i>

61
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,000
那我的丈夫Hector
Oh, that's my husband, Hector.

62
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,700
哇 他猪猪背了头猪回来
Whoa. He's giving that pig a piggyback.

63
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,540
我看到他有一支来复枪
Well, I see he has a rifle.

64
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,980
小心别让这孩子碰那玩意儿
Just keep it away from this little guy.

65
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,210
天知道他拿了枪会干出什么事儿来
God knows what he's capable of.

66
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,920
好了 他归你了 不得退换哦
OK, he's all yours. No returns.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,870
哈 只是开个玩笑
Oh, I'm just joking.

68
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,230
你有我的电话号码
OK. You've got my number, so just,

69
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,820
如果有问题就打电话给我 好吗
uh, ring me if you've got any trouble. OK?

70
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,190
再见 Ricky
Bye, Ricky.

71
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,490
再见 Ricky
Bye, Ricky.

72
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,900

00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,500
走吧 Andy
OK, let's go, Andy.

74
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,080
Ricky 那是Hec 你愿意的话也可以叫他叔叔
Ricky, this is Hec. You can call him Uncle, if you like.

75
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,260
不行 没门儿
No, he can't.

76
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,120
你想做点什么呢 饿了吗
What do you want to do? Are you hungry?

77
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,600
瞧我问这问题是不是傻了 看你这身型就知道了嘛 哈哈哈
That's a silly question, isn't it? Look at you.

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,360
你以前在农场干过活吗 还是你根本就是个绣花枕头大草包
You ever worked on a farm before or you just... ornamental?

79
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,240
Hec 想当初我们刚刚相遇的时候
Hec. Just remember when we first met,

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,790
你看起来也不怎么样啊
you weren't much good to anyone.

81
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,330
也只不过是个脏兮兮一身酒臭味的流浪汉罢了
Just a scruffy white drifter who smelled like methylated spirits.

82
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,730
晚安
Goodnight.

83
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,870
啊 宝贝你说什么
Eh? What's that, dear?

84
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,240
晚安
Goodnight.

85
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,040
唉...
Oh...

86
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,940
天啊 Hec 你个白痴
Jeez, Hec. You bloody idiot.

87
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,050
怎么了
What?

88
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,920
Ricky
Ricky?

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,020
小伙子 你还好吗
Buddy? Are you OK?

90
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,920
别在意Hec说的那些 他就是个老混球罢了
Sorry about Hec. He's a silly old goat, that's all.

91
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,230
好啦 我希望你喜欢你的房间 宝贝
OK, well, I hope you like your room, petal.

92
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,930
他们说你喜欢读书 所以我给你找了些书来
They said you liked to read, so I got a bunch of books for you,

93
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,650
房间里还有个印度台灯
and you'll also notice an Indian lamp,

94
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,730
一个牛头狗台灯 几个猫摆设
a bulldog lamp, and some cats,

95
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,800
还有一把漂亮锋利的小刀 你可以用来杀个夜魔啥的
and a nice sharp knife to kill monsters in the night.

96
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,440
孩子 我知道你曾经历过很多磨难
I can't imagine what you've been through,

97
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,070
你这一路走来肯定不容易
boy. You know, I can't imagine it was easy.

98
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,880
但是现在这儿就是你的家
But you're here now. This is home.

99
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,000
不管怎样 你能来这儿真好
Anyway, it's really nice to have you here,

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,320
我在你床上放了个热水袋
and I left a hottie in your bed.

101
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,980
我们明早见
We'll see you in the morning.

102
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,450

晚安 早上见
Nigh-night, then. See you in the morning.

106
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,480
上帝啊 孩子 我们找到你真是个奇迹
Jeez, boy, it's a miracle we found you

107
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,480
你居然成功地逃了两百米远
You made it all of 200m.

108
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,280
我只是出来透透气罢了
I was just taking a break.

109
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,850
Hec在做早饭
Hec's cooking breakfast.

110
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:34,990
有鸡蛋 培根 香肠 还有烤煎饼
Eggs, bacon, a few sossies on the side,... pancakes.

111
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,610
来吧 先把早饭吃了 然后你再逃也不迟
Come on. Have some breakfast, then you can run away.

112
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,710
见鬼 我踩到屎了
Oh man. I got poop on my kicks.

113
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,720
快滚开 臭虫
Go away, insect!

114
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,490
煎饼味道不错
Good pancake.

115
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,560
你的狗叫什么名字
So, what's your dog's name?

116
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,790
Zag
Zag.

117
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,320
<i>[Zag and Zig:澳大利亚电视节目中的两个小丑]
你应该再养一只 叫它Zig
You should get another one and name it Zig.</i>

118
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,030
Bella让我告诉你
Bella told me to tell you that...

119
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,240
你该给我找点活干
you should give me something to do.

120
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,340
你想让我干点什么吗
Is there anything you want me to do?

121
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,600
有啊 离我远点儿
Yeah,... leave me alone.

122
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,240
没问题
Cool.

123
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,260
早上好
Morning.

124
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,730
早上好 我还以为你逃跑了
Morning. I thought you were running away.

125
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,230
我是跑了 但是有东西忘了带 就又回来了
I did, but I forgot something, so I came back.

126
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,800
不错啊 Ricky 看到你这么有积极性真让人高兴
Oh. Good for you, Ricky. Good to see some initiative.

127
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,040
你熟悉这个雨林吗
You ever been up in that jungle before?

128
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,340
哦 这不是雨林 只是个灌木丛而已
Oh, it's not a jungle; it's the bush.

129
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,110
大约有一百万公顷呢 小子
There's about a million hectares of it, buddy.

130
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,650
只是“灌木林”而已吗
You said "Bush".

131
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,220
我就是从那儿来的 那边的深山里面
I'm from up there, deep in the mountains.

132
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,780
你经常回去吗
You ever go back much?

133
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,350
很久没有了 回去一趟不容易啊 很容易迷路
Not for a long time. It's a hard journey, easy to get lost.

134
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,420
那上面有一个湖 名字叫Makutekahu
We got a lake up there called Makutekahu.

135
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,060
湖面宽阔高远 可以一直延伸至天际洇湿天边漂浮的云彩
It's so high up it wets the cloak of the sky.

136
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,800
那里是我们的灵魂升上天堂时的必经之地
It's the first place our spirits go on their way to Reinga.

137
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,500
我的生命终结之时 我也会去那里
Yeah, when my time comes, that's where I'll go too.

138
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,470
你们这里真的有好多死了的东西呢
Man, you guys got a lot of dead stuff round here.

139
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,380
我那天还看见一只死羊 都长蛆了
Saw a dead sheep the other day. Had maggots in it.

140
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,180
无数的蛆
There's heaps of maggots,

141
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,880
在羊身上爬来爬去
maggots wriggling in that sheep

142
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,620
像蠕动的白米一样 真恶心
like moving rice. Yuck.

143
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,060
这是我为蛆编的俳句
That was my haiku about maggots.

144
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,500
名字就叫 “蛆”
It's called "Maggots".

145
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,300
这是负责我心理辅导的女士教我的
This counsellor lady made me do them when I got in trouble.

146
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,440
我有麻烦的时候就编这个 有助于表达我的感受
They help me express my feelings.

147
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,740
- 就是一种诗…… - 我知道什么是俳句
- They're poems made up of... - Yeah. I know what a haiku is.

148
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,510
我写了好多……你还想听听吗
I got heaps of them... want to hear another one?

149
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,310
想啊
Sure.

150
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,950
没问题
Ok.

151

<i>[Kingi 是本片导演Taika Waititi在2010年执导的另一部影片“ Boy” 中的角色名]
“Kingi 你个杂种”
"Kingi, you wanker.”</i>

152
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,090
“你个狗屎混蛋 我TM的恨死你了”
"You arsehole. I hate you heaps.

153
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,920
“真希望你快点痛苦地死翘翘”
"Please die soon in pain."

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,260
这首叫“Kingi 你个杂种”
That was called "Kingi, you Wanker".

155
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,390
够了够了 我知道了 今天不说俳句了
Yeah, yeah. OK. Got ya. Got ya. That's enough haikus for today.

156
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,900
来来 坐下 给我搭把手
Come on. Sit down. Come and give me a hand.

157
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,200
就像这样
Well, it's like this,

158
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,670
再把毛放到袋子里
and then you put it in this bag.

159
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,110
简单吧
Easy.

160
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,580
来吧 这个归你
Here you go. You have a go.

161
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,150
你是不是想干点其他的活啊
Do you want to try something else?

162
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,780
是的 还是干点儿别的吧
Yes, please.

163
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,140
我想象自己是个毛利战士
I'm imagining I'm a Maori warrior,

164
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,360
而那边那个瓶子就是个英国兵
and that bottle over there is a British soldier,

165
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,760
我正在保护我所有的老婆们
and I'm defending all my wives.

166
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,330
<i>[Te Kooti （1832-1893）著名的毛利人游击队领袖和活动家]

All right, Te Kooti.</i>

167
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,850
把你的目标
Well, you just keep the

对准你准星上面的这个小凹口
target above the little notch in the sight.

169
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,470
当你准备好以后 就深呼吸 然后...
And then when you're ready, you just breathe-

170
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,340
我勒个去
Bloody hell!

171
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,310
我们要猎什么
So, what are we hunting?

172
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,540
什么都行 运气好的话 说不定能打着鹿
Oh, anything. Deer, if we're lucky.

173
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,180
那边的坡上有群马 我们能开枪打一匹吗
Can we shoot one of those horses up there?

174
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,180
你猜呢 你觉得我会不会同意
Oh, I'll give- I'll give you one guess what my answer will be.

175
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,420
好吧 那么我骑一下总可以吧
Well, can I ride one?

176
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,690
没人可以骑它们 它们太野了
Nobody can ride them; they're too wild.

177
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,550
再说我们为什么要去骑它们啊
Why do they need to be ridden, anyway?

178
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,390
因为它们在那里就是让我们骑的嘛
Well, that's what they're there for.

179
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,400
那就让它们在那里吃吃草
Why can't they just eat

180
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,230
安安分分地当马不行吗
grass and be horses and leave it at that, eh?

181
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,360
好吧 好吧 我只不过是想聊个天嘛
OK, OK. I was just making conversation.

哦耶 我们的晚餐搞定了
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! That's dinner sorted!

186
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,370
想不想帮我把它的内脏挖出来啊
Whoa! Want to help me gut it?

187

万岁
Hooray!

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,390
来吹蜡烛吧
Go on, blow out your candles.

190

好
Ok.

191
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,650
Hector 不如现在给Ricky生日礼物吧
Hector, do you think it's time we gave Ricky his present?

谢谢阿姨 谢谢叔叔
Thank you, Auntie! Thank you, Uncle!

好好喂它 帮它洗澡 它是你的狗了 你要对它负责哦
Feed him, clean up after him. He's yours- you're responsible.

194
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,060
这是我庆祝过的最好的生日了
This is the best birthday I've ever had.

195

也是我唯一庆祝过的生日
I think it's the only birthday I've ever had.

196
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,580
你要帮它取什么名字
What are you gonna call him?

197
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,570
我还在琢磨 我想取个凶悍点的名字 能表现出它的真实本性的那种
Um, still thinking. Something fierce to reflect its true nature.

198

Tupac 是什么

Are you gonna run away tonight?

202
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,250
还不确定
Not sure.

203
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,260
没事的 我无所谓的啦
No, oh, it's cool with me.

204
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,160
只要你保证在吃早餐前能回来就行了
Just make sure you're back by breakfast.

有时候 在生命里
You know, sometimes in life,

218
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,360
看起来似乎已经无路可走
it seems like there's no way out-

219
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,760
你就好像是一只绵羊 被困在了由狼群设计的迷宫中
like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves.

220
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,070
但事实是 当你陷入这种困境的时候
And you know that if you're ever in that situation,

221
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,200
面前总会有两扇门可以让你选择
there are always two doors to choose from.

222
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,500
当你通过第一扇门的时候...
And through the first door- oh,

223
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,870
当然第一扇门嘛 是很容易通过的
it's easy to get through that door-

224
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,630
在门的另一边等着你的
and on the other side waiting for

225
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,080
是你可以想象到的各种美味的东西
you are all the nummiest treats you can imagine-

226
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,080
芬达 玉米片 派罗瓦柠檬汽水 汉堡圈 无糖可乐
Fanta, Doritos, L&P, Burger Rings, Coke Zero.

227
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,990
但你知道吗 还有另外一扇门
But you know what? There's also another door,

228
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,820
不是汉堡圈的门 也不是芬达的门
not the Burger Ring door, not the Fanta door;

229
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,920
是另外一扇更难通过的门
another door that's harder to get through.

230
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:11,380
猜猜门里边有什么东西 有人想要来猜一猜吗
Guess what's on the other side? Anyone want to take a guess?

231
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,530
蔬菜吗
Vegetables?

232
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,670
不 不是蔬菜
N-No, not vegeta-

233
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,310
不是
No.

234
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,480
是耶稣吗
WOMAN : Jesus?

235
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,750
我就知道你可能会想到耶稣
You would think Jesus. I thought

236
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,650
我开始也以为是耶稣来着 在我...在我第一次通过那扇门的时候
Jesus the first time I-I-I-I came across that door.

237
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,350
不是耶稣啦 里面是另外一扇门
It's not Jesus. It's another door.

238
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:36,620
那猜猜这扇门里面会是什么
And guess what's on the other side of that door?

239
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,660
耶稣
Jesus.

240
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,560
耶稣 对 是耶稣
Jesus. Yeah, Jesus.

241
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,660
耶稣可真够狡猾的 是吧
He's tricky like that, Jesus.

242
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,330
所以我们一起来向耶稣祷告吧
So let us pray, to Jesus, please,

243
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,760
祈祷他能让我们更容易地
and make it a bit easier

244

通过那些门 去发现自我
to get through those doors, uh, to find you

Yeah, they can.

那我们就坚持继续在这里生活
What if we just keep living here,

如果他们想把农场抢走
and if they try to take the farm,

我们就跟他们枪战 誓死捍卫到底 就像电影<疤面煞星>那样
we'll just have a shootout, like Scarface.

你必须要回去了
You're gonna go back,

他们会给你找个新家的 好吗
and you're gonna stick it out in a new home. OK?

279
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,180
这是不可能的 没门儿
There's no way that's happening.

我会进灌木林里住些日子 我需要...  消失一段时间
Well, I'm gonna go bush. I'm gonna... disappear for a while.

281
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,690
消失 这听起来更像是我要做的事
Disappear? Yeah, that sounds more like me.

别这样嘛 我们可是一伙的
Come on! We'll be a team!

老天啊 你在那里面连五分钟都呆不了
Oh, for God's sake. You wouldn't last five minutes out there.

284

Bella阿姨说过 你得好好照顾我
But Auntie Bella said you had to look after me

285

Can you just give me some privacy?

脸上就被泼硫酸了
on his face because he asked for more Weet-Bix.

290
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,730
嘿 你不能把阿姨就这么放到个箱子里
Hey, you can't put Auntie in a box.

291
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,880
够了 别说了
Give it a rest.

292
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
- 但是她是想要去天堂的啊  - 她已经不在了 好吗
- But she wanted to go to the sky place. - She's gone, OK?

293
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,040
这就是人生 前一天你还在这里
That's life- one day you're here,

294
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,580
下一天你就被装在个该死的盒子里了
and the next you're in a bloody box.

295
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
孩子 你给我听好
Just get this into your head,boy

296
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,210
是Bella想要你和我们一起生活 不是我
it was Bella that wanted you here, not me.

297
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,000
你觉得你可以留在这里 但事实上不行
I know you think this can work, but it can't.

298
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,420
福利院的人这个星期五就会过来
So the welfare people are coming on Friday.

299
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,220
他们会把你带走
They're coming to get you.

300
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,760
所以 就只能这样了吗
That's that, then?

301
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,060
对 只能这样了
Yep... that's that.

302
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,830
只能这样了
That's that.

303
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,280
我在这个谷仓里自焚了
永别了这个残酷的世界

304
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,320
我在这个谷仓里自焚了

305
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,380
不信你自己进去看

306
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,680
再见 Ricky Baker
Goodbye, Ricky Baker.

307
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,930
天啊
Uh-oh.

308
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,650
快走 Tupac 快走 Tupac
Come on, Tupac! Come on, Tupac!

309
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,380
BGM-"Ocean blue"

310
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,680
啊
Whoa!

311
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,300
吃了五片 还剩十片 加油 Ricky 坚持定量 省着点吃
Five down, 10 to go. Come on, Ricky. Stick on the rations.

312
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:19,080
我受够了 Tupac 我们回家吧
Stuff this, Tupac. We're going home.

313
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,270
你迷路了吗
Are you lost?

314
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,270
没有
No.

315
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,880
是的 你迷路了
Yeah, you are.

316
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,110
我告诉过你 你在这里待不过五分钟的
Told you you wouldn't last more than five minutes out here.

317
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,020
你已经完全绕晕了头 老实说你个路痴的程度连我都感到惊讶
You got yourself very lost. I'm amazed how lost you got.

318
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,050
我可是走得很快的 而且我已经在这里建立了我自己的世界
I move fast. I've got my own thing going on here-

319
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,120
Ricky小镇 人口  Ricky一个
Ricky Town. Population- Ricky.

320
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,260
是吗 现在是你回到现实小镇的时候了
Yeah, well. You're going back to Reality Town.

321
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,760
没门儿 我就住在这里了
Like hell. I live here now.

322
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,330
才怪
Like hell.

323
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,620
给我听好 跟在灌木林里转来转去浪费时间找你这个小混蛋相比
I've got better things to do than to run around the bush

324
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,920
老子要做的重要事情可多了去了
looking for little shits like you.

325
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,120
- 所以赶紧的 给我起来 - 我讨厌你
- So get up. - I hate you.

326
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,130
正好 我也讨厌你
Well, I hate you too.

327
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,500
你去死吧
I hope you die.

328
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,180
你也去死吧
Me too!

329
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,940
你不如现在就把我杀了吧
You may as well just kill me now.

330
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,480
不要杀我
Don't kill me.

331
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,680
反正能回城市的话 我也挺高兴的
Anyway, I'm excited to go back to the city.

332
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,380
很好
Good.

333
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,660
我等不及了 我讨厌这里 到处都是泥巴
Can't wait. I hate it here- so much dirt.

334
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,140
城市生活就很酷
It's going to be cool.

335
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,620
可以搞点新货色 当个毒贩子
Get me some new gears, become a drug dealer,

336
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,460
做个饶舌歌手  然后遇到飞车扫射 横尸街头什么的
a rapper, and die in a drive-by.

337
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,600
专心看好你前面的路
Just keep an eye on where you're going.

338
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,570
我都湿透了
This is wet.

339
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,910
我肚子饿了 我们在哪里啊
I'm hungry. Where are we?

340
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,140
闭嘴
Shut it.

341
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,980
我讨厌灌木丛
I hate the bush.

342
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,810
闭嘴
Shut it.

343
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,220
我鞋都湿啦
My shoes are wet.

344
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,900
还不是因为你这没用的小混蛋迷路了
You're the useless bugger who got lost in the first place.

345
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,120
给我记住
You remember that.

346
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,480
你连地图都没有么 地图呢
You don't even have a map. Where's our map?

347
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,390
不需要 我知道自己的位置
Don't need one. I know where I am.

348
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,190
就算有你也看不懂吧
Probably couldn't even read it anyway.

349
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,340
我为啥非要看懂地图啊
Why would I need to read a map?

350
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,380
跟你说了 我知道自己的位置  再说了 阅读是愚蠢的
I already told you- I know where I am. Reading is stupid anyway.

351
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,260
只有文盲才会这样说
Only people who can't read say things like that.

352
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,480
怎么啦
What?

353
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,360
不会吧 你不识字吗
No. You can't read?!

354
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,440
说话小心点 伙计
Watch it, pal.

355
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,600
你就像那种
You're like one of those people who are,

356
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,060
被狼之类的野兽养大的家伙 对吧
like, raised by, like, wolves or something, eh?

357
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,080
哈喽啊 偶 Hec 偶 字 不识
Ooga booga! Me Hec- me no read!

358
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,660
这是啥 是字哎 偶 蠢
What's this? This is words. Me stupid.

359
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,800
你个小杂...
You little bast...

360
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,080
我的脚
Ah, my foot.

361
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,700
没事吧
You OK?

362
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,980
不 我有事 都怪你 你个小杂种
No. I'm not OK. This is all your fault, you little bastard!

363
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,500
来吧 我扶你一把
Come on, let's get you comfortable.

364
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,060
我不是真的认为你是杂种
I don't really think you're a bastard.

365
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,000
不 你确实是这么认为的 但没关系啊 你也是杂种
Yeah, you do. That's OK, because I think you're a bastard too.

366
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,260
不管怎么样 这样才好 说出来就好了
Anyway, it's good. It's... healthy to get these feelings out.

367
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,570
还动不了吗
Can you move it yet?

368
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,710
废话 我的腿骨折了 很久才会好
'Course I can't. It's fractured. Take weeks to heal.

369
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,640
<i>[Debbie Downer 《周六夜现场》中的角色 总是用消极眼光做评判]
好吧 Debbie Downer 咱能想点积极的事儿吗
OK, Debbie Downer, can we think of something more positive?</i>

370
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,400
或许 你可以试试写个俳句 抒发下情感
Maybe you could... write a haiku to express your feelings.

371
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,140
写个什么
A what?

372
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,060
迷失于丛林
Lost in the forest.

373
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,590
疼痛的脚踝 可怜的叔叔
A sore ankle, poor uncle.

374
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,700
也罢 已释怀
Oh well, never mind.

375
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,100
哎呦老天 我们得赶快离开这地方
Oh God, we really need to get out of here.

376
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,580
你要我去找人帮忙吗
Do you want me to go find help?

377
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,700
但是我活不到那时候 对吧
I'd die, wouldn't I?

378
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,760
算了 我们别无选择 只能在这儿露营一段时间了
No, we've got no choice but to camp out here for a few weeks.

379
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,880
但是我饿了
But I'm hungry!

380
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,080
丛林里有足够的食物 只要你会找
There's plenty to eat if you know where to look.

381
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,880
但是我不知道去哪里找 Hector
Well, I don't know where to look,Hector.

382
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,820
还有 我厕纸也用完了
And also, I ran out of toilet paper.

383
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,720
把你的给我用下
Give me some of yours.

384
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,280
啥
Eh?

385
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,150
我要拉便便 我需要拉屎 你需要拉屎 大家都需要拉屎
I've gotta poop. I need a poop, you need a poop. We all poop.

386
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,090
用树叶
Use a leaf.

387
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,220
树叶
A leaf?

388
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,130
我恨你
I hate you.

389
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,420
然后把屎埋了
And bury it!

390
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,940
把你埋了还差不多
I'll bury you.

391
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,360
这才不是那娃儿烧焦的尸体
This ain't no charred foster kid.

392
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,810
你咋知道 Paula
How can you tell, Paula?

393
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,580
你觉得这像人头吗 Andy
Does this look like a human head to you, Andy?

394
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,600
你在哪里 Ricky Baker
Where are you, Ricky Baker?

395
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,480
那个 我猜是那个老头把他宰了 然后埋掉
Hey, I reckon the old man chopped him up, buried him somewhere-

396
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,090
或者吃掉了
Or ate him.

397
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,500
绝对是出事儿了 但到底是什么事呢
Something definitely happened, but I'm wondering what.

398
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,560
够了 Andy 把你的嘴闭上
OK, I'm gonna need you to shut up,Andy,

399
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,500
你快烦死我了
because you're doing my frickin' head in.

400
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,300
好了 我们走
Come on, let's go.

401
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,940
这事儿肯定还没完
This ain't over by a Mangaweka mile.

402
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,180
找警察来 这可是紧急事件
Get me the police. It's an emergency.

403
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,760
喂 等下 Paula 我就是警察啊
Hey, whoa, Paula. I am the police.

404
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,930
我是说真正的警察 Andy 带枪的那种
I mean real ones, Andy. Ones with guns.

405
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,290
嘿 叔叔 想听随身听吗
Hey, Uncle, wanna listen to my Walkman?

406
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,360
不想
No.

407
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,090
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

408
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,960
打猎
Hunting.

409
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,000
打你个头啊
Like hell.

410
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,430
你等会儿就知道谢谢我了
You can thank me later.

411
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,400
Tupac
Tupac!

412
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,680
来 来
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,360
打到猎物了吗
Did you get any food?

414
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,980
那是什么玩意儿
What the hell is that?

415
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,940
沙拉
Salad.

416
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,700
怎么了 你行你上啊
What? I'd like to see you do any better.

417
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,720
我还从没吃过呢 你鼻涕虫从哪儿弄来的
Never eaten a slug before. Where did you get it?

418
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,880
这是鳗鱼好么 在小溪下游抓到的
It's an eel. Got it down the creek.

419
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,640
我知道 但怎么抓呀 拿什么抓的
Yeah, but how? With what?

420
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,880
我也不知道 小技巧吧
Oh, I don't know. The knack.

421
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,880
哦 小技巧 什么技巧 你怎么学到的
Oh yeah, the knack. What's that? How do you get it?

422
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,900
也不算什么技巧吧 就是...
It's not a thing. It's just-

423
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,980
就这样抓到了 这是..
You just get it. It's a...

424
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,420
这是一种方法
Oh, it's a way of, um-

425
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,940
一种不需要想太多 也不需要说太多
it's a way of figuring things out without having to think too hard or...

426
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,880
就能捉摸出来的一种方法
or talk, more importantly.

427
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,540
你知道 大多数死于丛林里的人 被发现的时候都是赤身裸体的
You know, most people who die in the bush- they're found naked.

428
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,380
妈呀
Ew.

429
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,010
嗯 他们太害怕了
Yeah, they panic, and they

430
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,680
觉得身上的衣服一种拖累
think their clothes are slowing them down.

431
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,410
就把衣服扔了 然后就被冻死了
They throw them away, and then the cold gets to them.

432
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,010
但生存的窍门是 一种技巧
But the trick is- this is the knack-

433
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,280
你要保持冷静 寻找水源 顺着它向高处走
you stay calm, you look for water, you follow it to high ground

434
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,620
直到能够看清方位
until you can see what's going on.

435
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,400
如果之前我走失了 你会怎么办 会想念我吗
What would you do if I got lost today? Would you miss me?

436
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,980
你没有走失 所以 这很好
Well, you- you didn't get lost, so... that's good.

437
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,420
你想念Bella阿姨吗
Do you miss Auntie Bella?

438
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,040
嗯 你还没走出来

Look, we got lost; I got injured.

516
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,840
他完好无损 基本算是放了个假
He's fine. It was basically a holiday.

517
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,700
也不真放假 因为他让我干事情
Not a real holiday, because he made me do stuff.

518
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,460
什么事情
Like what?

519
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,830
就 那事儿呗 他腿脚不便 所以就让我帮他做
Just stuff. He had a sore leg, so he made me do things for him.

520
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,320
一开始挺难的
It was hard at first,

521
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,570
因为我的手太柔软细嫩了 但慢慢我就习惯了
because my hands are so soft. But I got used to it.

522

我也不愿意的
I didn't really want to do it,

523
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,540
可是不这么做我又小命不保
but it was the only way to survive.

524
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,380
也不是一直都很难 有时候我也会帮自己做一下
Well, it wasn't always hard. Sometimes I got to do my own thing.

525
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,150
尽管他几乎从不和我一起做
He pretty much never joined in with me, though.

526
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,150
我问他想不想和我一起做 但
I asked if he wanted to play with me, but...

527
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,560
他都会让我自己一边快活去
he would just make me play with myself.

528
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,530
恶心 太恶心了 恶心死了
I feel sick. I feel sick, Hugh.

It doesn't matter what you tell them;

586
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,960
他们不会信你的 他们会觉得是我逼你那么说的
they won't believe you. They'll think I made you do it.

587
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,680
我不想再蹲监狱了 我宁愿住在山上
I'm not going back to jail. I'm better off up here.

588
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,320
这地方不适合小孩子
This is no place for a kid.

589
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,650
你必须得回去 Ricky
You're going to have to go back, Ricky.

590
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,410
回哪儿
To what?

591
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,100
回福利中心的人那里去
Well, to the welfare people.

592
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,400
- 不要 - 他们会照顾你的
- No. - They'll look after you.

593
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,340
不 他们才不会
No, they won't.

594
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,100
他们会给你找个新家 没事的
They'll find you another home. You'll be fine.

595
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,160
不 你都不好好听我说 大家都是一个样
No. You're not listening! Nobody listens.

596
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,460
不会有什么新家的 只有少管所
There's no more homes, just juvie!

597
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,960
少管所是什么鬼地方
What's juvie?

598
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,260
少年犯管教所
Juvenile prison.

599
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,660
他们完全不关心像我这样的孩子
They don't care about kids like me.

600
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,000
他们只是不停地踢皮球
They just keep moving us around until...

601
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,020
直到我们自行毁灭 就像Amber一样
something happens, like... Amber.

602
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,640
天啊 那真够讨厌的
Oh, no. Bugger that.

603
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,620
好吧 好吧 我们在数百万公顷的丛林里 还挺大的
OK, OK. We're in about a million hectares of bush- that's big.

604
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,690
够我们在里面躲上一阵子了
It's big enough to enough to hide in for a while, anyway.

605
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,680
我没意见
Good enough for me.

606
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,700
但就快到冬天了
But we're heading into winter.

607
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,260
会很难熬 没有小屋 没有帐篷 真正的丛林生活
It's gonna be rough- no huts, no tents, real bush life.

608
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,060
你能应付吗
Can you handle that?

609
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,260
我能应付得来
I can handle it.

610
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,160
好 如果你给我惹麻烦 我就把你丢下
Yeah. And if you play up, I dump ya.

611
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,400
没问题 叔叔
OK, Uncle.

612
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,330
我还是不喜欢你叫我叔叔
I'd still prefer if you don't call me Uncle.

613
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,340
好吧 Hec 我们下一步怎么做
OK, Hec. So what do we do now?

614
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,820
我们跑路
We run.

615
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,880
等等 等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait.

616
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,960
不 不
No, no.

617
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,860
不对 我们用不着跑
No, we don't need to run.

618
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,980
是啊 我们改快走就好
Oh yeah. Let's just fast walk.

619
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,950
对 走吧
Yeah. Come on.

620
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,440
好 好 好 好 太好了
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

621
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,750
相当壮观 是吧
Pretty majestical, eh?

622
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:12,250
我觉得没有那么个单词
I don't think that's a word.

623
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,420
壮观 当然有了
Majestical? Sure it is.

624
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,450
不 那不是真的
Nah, it's not real.

625
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,360
你怎么知道不是
What would you know?

626
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,980
应该是 壮丽
It's "Majestic."

627
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,390
听上去没什么区别啊
Well, that doesn't sound very special.

628
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,580
壮观 听上去更好点
"Majestical" Is way better.

629
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,600
你觉得这地方应该叫什么
What do you reckon this place is called, anyway?

630
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,960
你觉得这里会不会
Do you think it's that place

631
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,640
就是传说中外套会被天空弄湿的地方
where the cloak gets wet by the sky or something?

632
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,340
我不知道 那他妈是什么鬼
I don't know. What the hell does that mean?

633
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,520
Bella阿姨说她是从这儿来的
Auntie Bella said she was from up here-

634
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,600
从这个几乎连接天际的特殊的湖
from this special lake that almost touches the sky.

635
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,780
伙计 Bella不知道她自己从哪儿来的
Mate, Bella didn't know where she was from.

636
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,960
不 她说了
Nah, she said-

637
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,150
不 那都是她编的
No. She was making it up.

638
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:52,800
听着 Bella没有任何家人 就像你我一样
Look, Bella didn't have any family. Like you. Like me.

639
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,160
所以她才想要照顾你 还有同情我
That's why she wanted to look after you... and took pity on me.

640
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,640
她想解救我们这些被所有人拒之门外的可怜虫
She wanted to save us poor wretches when no one else wanted us.

641
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,620
就像搜救犬一样
Like rescue dogs.

642
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,760
这就是她的为人 有颗金子般的心
That's the way she was. Heart of gold.

643
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,300
没错 这很壮观
Yeah, it's majestical.

644
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,000
赶紧搭帐篷吧 好吗
May as well camp, eh?

645
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,760
太阳快要落山了
Sun is going down.

646
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,530
事件新进展 更多关于这次大规模全国搜捕的消息
Developing story now, more on this massive national manhunt.

647
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,040

649
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,870
Paula 欢迎你
Paula, thank you for being here...

650
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,570
- 早上好 - 和我们谈谈这个男孩
- Good morning. - Tell us about this boy.

651
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,810
他是个怎样的孩子
What kind of character are we talking about?

652
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,590
听着 我们
Well, look, we're-

653
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,380
我们谈论的这个小男孩是个擅长偷窃
We're talking about a young boy who is capable of stealing,

654
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,250
随地吐痰 乱踢乱砸 破坏公物
spitting, breaking stuff, kicking stuff, defacing stuff,

655
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,850
偷东西 烧东西
stealing stuff, burning stuff and,

656
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,580
胡乱涂鸦的人
uh, loitering and graffiti-ing. Yeah.

657
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,080
即便如此 Paula 他还只是个孩子
Mm. Even so, Paula, he's just a kid,

658
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,440
是吧 他孤身一人在丛林里 他肯定很害怕
right? He's alone in the bush. He's scared.

659
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,460
害什么怕 不 不 他不怕 他不是个胆小的孩子
Scared? No, no. He's not- He's not a scared little kid.

660
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,020
他是个乱动的扳手
He's a spanner in the works,

661
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,380
而我是那个负责抓住扳手
and I'm the mechanic who is gonna take that spanner

662
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,070
- 并把它放回工具箱的修理工 - 好吧
- and put him back in the toolbox. - OK.

663
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:19,740
把他放到属于他的地方 不放弃任何一个孩子 不放弃任何一个孩子
... where he belongs. No child left behind. No child left behind.

664
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,000
不放弃任何一个孩子
No child left behind.

665
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,250
他会知道这话是什么意思的
He'll know what that means.

666
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,290
好吧
Ok.

667
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,900
找到了吗
Any luck?

668
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,280
我们在绿色区域的某处
We're somewhere in this green bit.

669
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,280
这里曾经有人居住 我们还不算迷路
Well, people used to live here, so we can't be that lost.

670
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,640
说不定他们也迷路了
They probably got lost too,

671
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,610
然后就放弃了 我们大概也会死在这里
and then just gave up. We'll probably die here.

672
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,260
知道了就闭嘴吧
Well, anything to shut you up.

673
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,780
只要那只蠢鸟闭嘴我也会闭嘴的
I'll shut up if that stupid bird shuts up.

674
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,720
闭嘴 死鸟
Shut up, stupid bird!

675
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,980
看着
Just watch.

676
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,930
没见过这么迟钝的鸟
Huh. Never seen a dumb bird like that before.

677
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,440
好好看着
Just watch.

678
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,640
是只垂耳鸦
It's a huia.

679
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,710
<i>[新西兰特有的珍稀鸟类]
我觉得那鸟是垂耳鸦
I reckon that bird was a huia.</i>

680
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,440
这种鸟应该灭绝了才对
Supposed to be extinct.

681
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,440
那很稀罕啊
That's pretty rare.

682
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,230
伙计 肯定有很多人
Mate,... I reckon there'd be a lot

683
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,220
想要看看这种珍稀动物
of people interested in seeing something like that.

684
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,180
发现它们的人肯定会...出名
And the people who discovered them would be... pretty famous.

685
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,860
对 说不定还能赚点钱
Yeah, probably some money in it too.

686
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,060
友情提示 我们还需要照片作证呢
Mind you, need some photos to prove it.

687
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,080
但我们没有照相机
We don't have a camera.

688
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,270
你上次洗澡是什么时候
When was the last time you washed?

689
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,130
大概一个月前
About a month ago.

690
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,980
明显洗得不够勤快啊 是吧
Well, that's not enough, eh?

691
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,560
好了 伙计 我们走吧
OK, mate. Let's go.

692
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,000
你那里有什么发现
What have you got there mate?

693
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,070
嗯 哦 几本书
Huh? Oh books.

694
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,800
几本书 去你的书 找点吃的和暖和的东西
Books? Bloody books. Look for food and warm stuff.

695
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,540
好吧 好吧 好吧 别那么心急
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep your pants on.

696
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,720
天哪 是护林员
Jeez. That's a ranger.

697
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,180
他死了
Oh, he's dead.

698
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,990
老天
Oh Jeez.

699
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,060
伙计 你还好吗 你怎么了
You all right, mate? What's the matter?

700
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,620
Ricky 我们得做点什么
Ricky, we've got to do something.

701
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,070
你不会要杀人分尸吧
Are you going to manslaughter him?

702
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,430
我可受不了这么血腥的场面
Because I don't think I can watch.

703
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,730
不是 你个熊孩子 我 我们必须帮他一把
No, you idiot. I'm- We've got to get him some help.

704
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:53,980
外面有条通向河流的小路
There's a track down to a river;

705
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,670
有几户人家住在林子里
there's some bush people that live down there.

706
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,800
大概要走上两个小时
It's about a two-hour trek.

707
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,500
我们可以在天黑前走到那里
We can make it before dark.

708
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,910
好吧 但总要有人留下来照顾这个人啊
Well, someone has got to stay behind and look after this bloke.

709
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:04,680
那你慢慢照顾吧
Have fun.

710
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,770
别到处乱逛 跟着路径走
Now don't go wandering; just stick to the tracks.

711
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,800
如果实在没招了
If you get desperate,...

712
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,510
就吃了你的狗
eat your dog.

713
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:12,600
什么
What?

714
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,140
你不会有事的 伙计
You'll be right, mate.

715
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,940
赶紧回来就行了 知道不
Just bloody well come back, OK?

716
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,970
好吧
Ok.

717
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,890
你在那里干什么呢 傻孩子
What do you think you're doing out here, freaky kid?

718
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,000
卡灵顿那儿的木屋里有人病倒了
There's a sick man up at Carrington Hut.

719
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
他没法走路 也没法呼吸
He can't walk, and he's having trouble breathing.

720
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,400
你能不能叫个直升飞机来
Can you radio in a chopper?

721
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,770
好吧 没问题
OK. Sweet as.

722
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:09,710
对 请尽快派一架直升飞机过来 完毕
"Uh, yeah, we need a helicopter up here ASAP. Over."

723
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,280
我看起来像是带了对讲机吗
Does it look like I carry a radio?

724
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,230
他生什么病了
What's wrong with him?

725
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,420
我不知道 也许快要死了
I don't know. He might be dying.

726
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,510
呃 好吧 过来 我们去打电话叫警察过来
Ew. Oh, OK. Come on, we'll go call the cop.

727
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,250
上来吧 小子
Get on, man.

728
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,220
Bruce 我已经告诉你了 在卡灵顿那个木屋里
I've already told you, Bruce- up at Carrington Hut.

729
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,940
他大概已经死了
He's probably already dead by now.

730
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,500
想要点冰激凌吗
Do you want some ice cream?

731
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,050
我怎么知道 有点责任心 飞过去看一眼

If you want me to talk for ages, or if you don't me to talk,

752
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,460
那就直接告诉我你不想听我说话
just tell me if you don't want me to talk.

753
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,730
就好像 有一次我在学校 一直说个不停
Like, this one time I was school, and I was talking too much,

754
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,000
然后老师走进来
and the teacher walks in-

755
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,670
我没听她说话 因为她是我阿姨...
I'm not listening to her, because she's my Auntie...

我在向这位兄弟传授人生经验
I'm imparting my knowledge on the bro.

788
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:45,620
你为什么要逃走 就不能过得正常点吗
Why are you on the run? Don't you want a normal life?

789
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,560
不知道 也许吧
Don't know. Maybe.

790
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,370

You fullas could come live here.

791
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,060
他们永远不会找到你们的 没人会来这里
They'll never find you. Nobody ever comes in here.

792
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,200
我要先问问叔叔
I have to ask Uncle first.

793
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,630
他们说他很危险 你们处得来吗
They say he's dangerous. You guys get along?

00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,670
我们就像最好的朋友 我们相处得很好

我不知道我爸爸是谁
Don't know who my dad was,

801
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:18,450
我很小的时候我妈妈就把我抛弃了

806
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,450
算了 你没必要去 应该是她来找你
Oh, you don't have to. She should find you.

跟我说说 现在是什么情况
So, talk to me, Gav. What's the situation?

834
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,300
搜查结果表明 小屋是空的
Uh, well, the hut is empty

835
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,600
所以他们一定在我们来之前离开了这里
so they must've left before we got here.

836
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,100
哟 看来你已经看穿了一切 Gav
Ooh, you worked that out on your own, Gav

837
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,320
还有什么线索

838
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,210
我们还在这里
Well, uh, we've, ah, set up

839
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,000
设立了一个搜查队的集合点
a rendezvous spot here for the search party.

840
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,760
这样他们就可以把黄貂鱼弄进来
And, uh, then we can bring in, uh, Stingray.

841
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,980
什么鱼 跟我好好说说
Stingray? Talk to me, talk to me.

842
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,120
简单来说就是
Oh, well, basically it's just a

843
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,080
一个可以发射出错误频率的便携式手机信号塔
portable cell phone tower that emits a false frequency.

844
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:36,100
周围五千米以内的手机会默认其为普通网络信号
So any cell phone in a 5 K radius will latch on,

845
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,680
一旦连接就可以找到位置了
thinking it's an ordinary network.

846
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,060
<i>[五只眼 Five eyes 情报联盟]
棒极了 就像五只眼的那些玩意儿
Frickin' A, brother. That's some "Five eyes" Shit right there.</i>

847

Oh! Tupac, find Zag.

850
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,440
你这个没用的家伙 再想想 Rickey 好好想一想
Oh, you're useless. Oh! Think, Ricky, think.

851
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,680

Oh yes. Yes! Find water, and then go to higher ground.

853
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,500
千万别脱光衣服
And don't get naked.

854
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,020
Rickey Backer 和 Hector Faulkner
Ricky Baker and Hector Faulkner-

855
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,840
这两个不法之徒已经逍遥法外四个月了
two renegade outlaws on the run for four months now,

856
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,840
迅速成为了新西兰的传奇
and fast becoming legends here in NZ.

857
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,610
自从上次在木屋救了护林人之后
Faulkner and Baker's popularity is on the rise

858
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:37,350
Faulkner和Baker的受欢迎程度正在火热上升
after a valiant effort to save a critically ill park ranger.

859
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,520
全国都在全力搜寻他们
The forces are circling against them,

860
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,890
这让我想起了《第一滴血》
and I am reminded of "First Blood".

861
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:47,320
John Rambo 一个人
John Rambo, a man alone- obviously they're two men alone-

862
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,380
不过他们是两个人
out there somewhere beyond

863
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,500
独自在这样野草茂密的灌木丛中生存
the cutty grass in this dense, thick bush.

864
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,470
看好了 就这样 简单粗暴 明白了吗
OK? Easy, efficient, economic. All right, guys?

865
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,780
我们来看看 当时发生了什么...
Take us back a step. What happened in...?

866
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,710
我有些失控 然后跟他扭打在一起
Uh, I lost control and, uh, I gave him the beating of his life.

867
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,000
我把他狠狠地揍了一顿
Yeah, you got him good.

868
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,220
我们悬赏一万元捉拿他们
We're offering $10,000 to

869
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,440
活要见人 死要见尸
anyone who can capture them, dead or alive.

870
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,600
哦 要活的 要捉活的啊
Oh,... alive. They should be alive.

871
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,880
他们是为自由作斗争
They are fighting for freedom.

872
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:21,420
新西兰的自由是不可侵犯的 这是一种壮举
And we believe in freedom in NZ. It is a marvellous thing.

873
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,730
Rickey 站住
Oi! Ricky! Freeze!

874
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:35,170
站在那儿别动我们马上过来
- OK, OK. OK, Ricky. Stay there we're coming over to you. - Come on.

875
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,840
这里太陡了我没法过去 Rickey 你过来
It's too steep. It's too steep. Ricky, you come across here.

876
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,660
我不要
No.

877
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,760
只需要滑下来 跨过这条小溪
Just slide down the bank, cross this stream,

878
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,520
然后爬上来 你会安全度过的
and then climb up to us. You're absolutely safe.

879
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,150
你只需要抓住一些树枝什么的就行了 好吗
All you have to do is grab some branches or some roots. OK?

880
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:47,760
我不过去
No.

881
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,180
Ricky 现在立刻给我过来
Ricky. Come over here right now!

882
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,460
我不会回去的 谁要跟你回少管所
I'm not going back. I'm not going to juvie.

883
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,100
小伙子 你这是在玩火
You are playing with a bag of snakes, boy.

884
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,390
你会引火烧身的知道不
A big bag with a lot of holes in it.

885
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,260
你捅了这么大的篓子 全国上下都在找你
You've got the whole country looking for you.

886
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,920
我不会放弃的
I'll never stop running.

887
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,380
我也会追你到天涯海角的
Yeah, and I'll never stop chasing you.

888
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,180
我会像终结者那样无情
I'm relentless. I'm like the Terminator.

889
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,580
我比你更像终结者
I'm more like Terminator than you.

890
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,600
<i>[终结者中的角色]
我先说的 你最多就是个Sarah Conner
I said it first. You're more like Sarah Connor.</i>

891
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:07,690
<i>[终结者中的角色]</i>

892
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:08,540
不 我才不是
No, I'm not.

893
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,940
没错 你是第一部的她 弱鸡一个
Yes. And in the first movie too, before she could do chin-ups.

894
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,880
我们不用搞那么多有的没的 Ricky
It doesn't have to be this difficult, Ricky. Yeah?

895
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:20,350
你又冷 又沮丧 还很饿
You're cold, you're damp... and hungry.

896
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,450
看看这个 混合坚果
Look at that- scroggin.

897
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,360
里面有坚果和一些干果
Got some nuts and dried fruit...

898
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,660
还有些巧克力碎 看起来就很好吃
Little pieces of chocolate. Delicious.

899
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:31,580
我们可以做个交易
We could cut a deal; make a trade.

900
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,840
什么交易
What kind of deal?

901
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,100
供出那个老家伙
The old man.

902
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,680
你就说是他逼你这么做的 让他来背这个黑锅
You say that he made you do it, let him take the rap,

903
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,040
这样我就不会把你丢到少管所去
and I'll make sure you never go back to juvie.

904
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,180
我们会给你找个新家 给你再找一个好妈妈
We'll find you a new foster home; a new Bella.

905
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,020
我拒绝
No deal.

906
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,380
得了吧 Sarah Conner 别做蠢事
Oh, come on, Sarah Connor. Don't be a fool.

907
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,250
绝不拿家人做交易
You don't trade family for anything.

908
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:54,250
好吧 那你就继续逃吧
Well, you just keep running.

909
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:57,590
他在这里 我们抓到他了
He's here! He's here. We got him!

910
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,640
快追
Go! Go! Go!

911
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,180
所以 你吃肠 她唱歌 然后你就睡了
OK. So you ate a sausage, she sang a song, and you went to sleep.

912
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:35,320
能怪我么 歌曲让人放松 香肠也让人放松
What? It was a relaxing song... and a relaxing sausage.

913
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,820
我们是不是走了一千英里了
Do you think we've walked

914
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,500
就像角马一样
a thousand miles yet? Like the wildebeest?

915
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,140
感觉像是走了很远是吧
Well, it feels like it, eh?

916
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:48,200
是的 一刻都不能消停 还要担心猎人们的追捕
Yeah. Always on the move, always on the lookout for hunters,

917
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:53,880
虽然我们是人类 但总是像动物一样
just like the wildebeest, except humans.

918
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,910
我们 我们是野蛮人
We're... Wilderpeople.

919
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,260
没错 就是这样
Yeah, that's us.

920
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,850
那好 野孩子 我们找个地方坐下来吃点东西 怎么样
OK then, Wilderboy, let's find somewhere to eat, shall we?

921
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:03,920
是他们
There they are!

922
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,720
别动
Freeze!

923
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:10,090
又要 动真格了
Shit just got real. Again.

924
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,230
丢掉你们的武器
Now, drop your weapons.

925
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,860
可是我们没拿着武器啊
We're not holding any weapons-

926
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:13,540
我不管 把手上的东西都扔掉
Drop 'em!

927
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,700
去查一下他们的东西 Ricky
Go see what they got, Ricky.

928
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,140
烤豆子
Baked beans,

929
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,910
意面
spaghetti,

930
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,120
这是什么鬼
ba- baba- What?

931
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,210
<i>[茄子泥]
那是芭芭卡奴士
Oh, baba ganoush.</i>

932
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,110
什么
What?

933
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,260
就是芭芭卡奴士
Baba ganoush.

934
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,080
怎么了
What?

935
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,600
望远镜
Binoculars,

936
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,020
绳子和胶带
rope, gaffer tape.

937
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:44,560
Ricky 把他们的枪拿过来
Get their guns, Ricky.

938
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,160
把你们的枪给我
Give me your guns.

939
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,740
把螺栓都拔掉
Take the bolts out.

940
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,370
有人悬赏捉拿你们
There's a reward for your capture.

941
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,940
赏金多少
How much?

942
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,240
一万
10 grand.

943
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,860
涨到二十万再告诉我们
Tell us when it gets to 20.

944
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,140
如果他们问起来是谁干的
And when they ask who did this,

945
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,250
告诉他们是野蛮人干的
tell them it was the Wilderpeople.

946
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,720
什么人
The What-er-people?

947
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:11,120
野蛮人
The Wilderpeople.

948
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,480
那里是Bella的农场
No, I can't go back there. It wasn't my farm;

949
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,680
所以我不能回去了
you know that. It was Bella's.

950
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,340
她管理一切
She ran the show. I could do

951
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,880
我只是打下手和养狗 她才是真正的农场主
stuff- me and the dog- but she was the farmer.

952
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,450
她还很会做饭
And the cook.

953
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,680
是啊 她做饭很好吃
Yeah, a bloody good cook too.

954
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:43,320
但是你不能就这么一辈子跑下去啊
But you- you can't keep on the run forever.

955
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,140
你需要回到社会
You've got to go back to society, you know that.

956
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,060
我对社会来说是个威胁
I'm a menace to society.

957
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,860
反正 就算回去了
Anyway, if I ever went back,

958
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,200
长大了最多就是个开压路机的
I'd probably end up driving a steamroller or something.

959
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,200
黑帮小混混通常都是这个下场
That's what happens to gangsters.

960
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,880
也没什么不好的啊
Well, there's nothing wrong with that,

961
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,420
但是如果你能在别的方面做得更好的话
but if you're better at something else,

962
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,340
为什么不去试试呢 对吧
then you should probably give that a go, shouldn't you?

963
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,200
是没错 不过我更擅长当个小混混
Yeah, but I'm better at being a gangster.

964
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,760
你才不是什么混混
You're not a bloody gangster.

965
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,700
你怎么知道
How would you know?

966
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,820
因为我见过真正的混混
Because I've known real gangsters,

967
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,010
他们比你粗鲁多了
and they're a lot tougher than you are.

968
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,210
他们应该很串吧
Yeah, but were they skux, though?

969
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,250
串 那是什么鬼
Skux? What the hell does that mean?

970
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,080
你懂的 就是串
You know,... skux.

971
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,600
到底是什么意思
Yeah, but what does it mean?

972
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,360
什么意思都有 很酷 很厉害的意思
Everything. It's cool, spunky,

973
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,260
聪明 又有型 你懂的 混混都那样
brainy, good-looking, you know, gangster.

974
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,060
我的老天 你真的不是混混
Oh, for God's sake. You're not a bloody gangster!

975
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:27,760
天
Oh, jeez.

976
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:29,840
Zag Tupac
Zag! Tupac!

977
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,460
回来 Zag 快回来
Get back, Zag! Get back! Come back here, you-!

978
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,170
退后 快退后 Zag
Get in behind! Get in behind, Zag!

979
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,110
Zag
Zag!

980
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,710
Zag
Zag!

981
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,180
快点出来 你个蠢货
Get out of it, you mongrel!

982
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:48,860
该死
Shit.

983
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,170
叔叔
Uncle!

984
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,880
你都干了些什么
What have you done?

985
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,300
我的老天
Oh jeez.

986
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,710
- 把枪给我 伙计
- Give us your gun, mate.

987
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,380
- 快点 离开这儿 - 不 叔叔
- Go on, get out. - No, Uncle.

988
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,260
- 离远点 - 叔叔
- Get out of - Uncle!

989
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,650
- 离开这儿 Ricky 快点 走开
Get out of here, Ricky. Go on, get out.

990
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,560
- 但我们就不能... - 走
- But can't we just... - Go!

991
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,250
写的什么
What does that say?

992
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,480
Zag
Zag.

993
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,280
很好
Good.

994
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,120
她一路上一直跟着我们 对吗
So, she's been with us the whole time, eh?

995
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,140
对
Yeah.

996
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:35,640
这里离天堂很近
Well, pretty close to the sky up here.

997
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,120
谢谢你带着她出来 伙计
Thanks for bringing her, mate.

998
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:51,890
BGM-Leonard cohen's "The partisan"

999
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,120
他们打算追捕我们到什么时候啊
I wonder how long they're going to hunt us for.

1000
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,710
难说
Oh, it's hard to say.

1001
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,780
这些蠢货进了丛林里连你都不如
Those idiots are worse in the bush than you are.

1002
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,620
无用至极 什么都找不到
Useless. Couldn't find a clown in a circus.

1003
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,650
停下 警察
Stop! This is the police!

1004
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:56,740
妈的
Oh shit!

1005
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:28,540
什么
What?

1006
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,360
我只是想给你说刚才那出跟<指环王>里的情节一样
I was trying to tell you it was like The Lord of the Rings.

1007
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,240
什么鬼
What the...?

1008
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,000
你看见那棵灌木了吗
Can you see that bush over there?

1009
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,100
看见了
Yeah.

1010
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,360
我是人还是灌木啊
Is it a man or a bush?

1011
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,480
灌木
Bush!

1012
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,780
人
Man!

1013
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,580
灌木人
Bushman!

1014
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:41,080
你们好啊 我一直想和你们来次偶然的邂逅呢
Hello. I was hoping to run into you two.

1015
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,760
如果你是冲着赏金来
Well, if you're after the reward,

1016
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,900
那就省省力气吧 我们可是危险人物
you can bugger off. We're dangerous.

1017
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,240
对 很危险
Yeah, we're dangerous.

1018
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,410
是啊 不 我都听说了
Yeah, no. I heard about that.

1019
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:49,900
别担心 我可没想抓你们
Don't worry. I'm not going to capture you.

1020
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,320
你们听过一个地方传说吗
You guys heard of a- a local legend

1021
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,070
说的是一个独自居住在这片丛林的人
about a guy who lives out here in the bush on this own?

1022
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,040
人称神经病Sam
They call him Psycho Sam!

1023
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:02,920
没有
No.

1024
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,780
没有吗 好吧
No? Oh, OK.

1025
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,340
总之 叫我Sam就行了
Well, my name is Sam, anyway.

1026
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:13,260
我是友军 来吧
I'm a friend! Come on.

1027
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,280
吃饼干吗
Bikkie?

1028
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,180
他为啥叫自己神经病Sam
Why do you reckon he calls himself Psycho Sam?

1029
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,760
给你们的 戴上这个 政府就找不到你们了
Here you go. Put these on. Stop the Government from tracking you.

1030
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,000
当我没问
Never mind.

1031
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,080
你们救的那个人是个护林员
That fulla you saved- he was a ranger.

1032
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,730
有糖尿病 那事之后你们得到了点支持
Diabetic. You got a little support over that.

1033
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,460
但不久后你们抢劫了那些赏金猎人
But then you robbed those hunters,

1034
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,580
所以你们又陷入了麻烦里
so you're back in the negatives again.

1035
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:59,420
都怪这家伙 就是个小疯子
Well, that was... this fella. He's the maniac.

1036
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,060
他们还一直说你是个危险人物
Well, they're still saying you're dangerous.

1037
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,400
而且有些变态
And a bit of a pervert.

1038
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:03,560
去他妈的
Goddammit.

1039
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,420
这都无所谓啦 我这里你们想住多久就住多久
It's all right. You can stay here as long as you like.

1040
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,440
我在这待了15年了
I've been up here 15 years now.

1041
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,560
东西齐全 他们追你们多久了
Got everything I need. How long they been chasing ya?

1042
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,380
没算过 大概五个月吧
I don't know. About five months now?

1043
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,660
混蛋 政府的都这德性
Bastards. That's the typical government.

1044
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,980
总是踩在小人物头上过活
Always trying to step on the little guy just for living his life.

1045
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,780
没完没了 所以我没法儿回去
It never stops either. That's why I can't go back.

1046
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,890
不想成为这系统的一部分
Not going to be part of the machine.

1047
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,060
表格填写器
Form fillers.

1048
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:24,740
什么表格填写器
Form fillers?

1049
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,000
他们就是这么折腾你的
That's how they get you.

1050
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,320
这辈子不管你想做啥 你都得填表
Anything you want to do in life, you got to fill out a form.

1051
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,760
他们给每件事都做了表
And they've got forms for everything.

1052
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,500
你填一张 那张就送走了
You fill it out, it goes upstairs,

1053
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,980
然后你又得填另一张
and then they make you fill out a new form,

1054
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,100
就为了确认前一张是你填的
just to confirm it was you that filled out the first form.

1055
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,480
一旦你不想填表了
And if ever you want to stop filling out forms,

1056
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,780
很好 你再填五张不同的表来申请
well, there's about five different forms for that.

1057
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,320
就差没拿个国家橄榄球队数目的表格出来
Don't even get me started

1058
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,940
让我填  真是毫无人性
on the national rugby team. They're not human.

1059
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,060
伙计 你做啥呢
What you doing, mate?

1060
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,670
写东西
Writing.

1061
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,480
那么Shakespeare先生 请问你在写什么大作
And what are you writing, Mr Shakespeare?

1062
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,220
写诗
Haiku.

1063
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,840
好吧 读来听听 我看你写得咋样
Well, go on, read it out. I'll tell you if it's any good.

1064
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,310
不行 这是隐私
No, it's just a personal one.

1065
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,980
行了 别扭扭捏捏的
Oh, come on. Don't be shy.

1066
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,780
好吧
Mm, OK.

1067
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,890
绿树 小鸟 河流 蓝天
Trees, birds, rivers, sky.

1068
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,560
和我Hec叔叔一起逃亡
Running with my Uncle Hec.

1069
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,100
永不分离
Living forever.

1070
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,480
看嘛 都说了很蠢
See? Told you it was dumb.

1071
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,560
不 没有
No, no.

1072
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,000
只是有点
It was just that

1073
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:46,360
怎么说呢 这是
Well, that's the...

1074
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,920
这是我第一次在诗里
That's the first time I've

1075
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,700
听见我的名字 我喜欢
heard my name in a poem. I liked it.

1076
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:59,650
Bella也会喜欢这次冒险的 对吗
Gee, Bella would have loved this adventure, wouldn't she?

1077
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:03,580
嗯 你俩咋不要孩子呢
Mm. Why couldn't you guys have any kids?

1078
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,100
只是要不了
Well, just couldn't.

1079
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,260
是我要不了
Well, I couldn't.

1080
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,570
这不公平 有些人要不了孩子
That's not very fair. Some people can't even have babies.

1081
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:18,320
而有些人有了孩子的人却不想要
And the ones who can- they don't even want them.

1082
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,980
就像我妈一样
Like my mum.

1083
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,860
不 小子 她想要你
No, mate. She wanted you.

1084
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,020
她可能 她可能只是太年轻了
She was- she was probably just young.

1085
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,320
不知道怎样养活你 明白吗
She couldn't work out how to raise you, you know.

1086
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,220
我打赌她很爱你
I bet she loved you, though.

1087
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,020
深表怀疑
Doubt it.

1088
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,190
反正你永远不会知道了
Well, you never know.

1089
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:35,960
你还是很讨人爱的
You're pretty likeable.

1090
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,320

Lights out, OK?

Yeah. Even I can't stand his cooking anymore.

1099
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,440

两个轮子跑... 四轮驱动跑
Both wheels go... go four-wheel-drive.

1133

May as well play it to the end. What do you reckon?

1158

你是说我们来场枪战 然后
You mean have a shoot out, and then

1159
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,080
等我们没子弹了 跑出去喊着 自由
when we've got no bullets, run out and say, "Freedom!"

1160
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,960
之后死得惊天动地吗
And then die in a blaze of glory?

1161
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,060
不 事实上我是说等我们把油耗光的时候

哦 好吧 我要死得惊天动地了
Oh. Well, I'm dying in a blaze of glory.
