vibration detection.

120
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,442
你知道这些人买的是什么吗？

他们买的是我们每天全身心的服务

不要藏在你的口袋里，袜子里
So don't hide it in your pocket

132
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,926
更不要粘在蛋蛋上，或塞在屁眼里
don't tape it under your balls
or stick it up your ass,

133
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,928
因为，我会找到的

BK 从来不检查我的蛋蛋

先生，你可以叫我Enrique，"Lil' Disco"，或"嘻嘻哈哈"
Sir, you can call me "Enrique" or "Lil' Disco"

What's invisible and smells like worms?

147
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,457
鸟p
Bird farts.

148
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,084
我们已经听过了
We've heard that one before.

149
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,460
在学校愉快
Have a great day at school.

150
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,087
早，Hightower先生
Morning, Mr. Hightower.

151
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,296
女士
Ma'am.

152
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,259
先生，您在开罗的包裹3天前到了
Sir, that package you ordered from Cairo
arrived three days early.

153
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,593
恩，对
Hmm.Yeah.

154
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,428
正在从飞机场赶过来呢
It's on its way from the airport right now.

155
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,596
Josh，你能叫司机
Josh, can you have the chauffeur

156
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,848
到后门等我们会吗？
pick us up at the back, please?

157
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,516
已经在了，谢谢
Already done.Thank you.

158
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,268
亲爱的，走吧
Darling, let's go.

159
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,982
那人的女儿像个 花鸡
That guy's daughter looks like a prostitute.

160
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,692
这里禁止评论
We're all about discretion here,Mr. Dev'Reaux.

161
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,361
好吧，你们怎么分小费的？
Right, right.How do you guys split up the tips?

162
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,238
我们不收小费
We don't. We never take tips at The Tower.

163
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,573
我不想谈这个
No, I don't really want to talk
about it right now.

164
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,241
- Charlie. - Sasha!

165
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,702
你兄弟来了，我上班了，不能聊天
Your brother's coming,
I'm at work and I can't talk right now.

166
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,663
你来晚了20分钟，Ramos法官的雪茄呢？
You're 20 minutes late!
Where are Judge Ramos' cigars?

167
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,789
这儿
Right here.

168
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,000
Josh，我受够了
Josh, I'm freaking out.

169
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,626
有什么需要帮忙的?
Can I help you?

170
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,752
忙你的
Go.

171
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,837
什么？
What?

172
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,173
我们刚做了孕检，3个月了
We just went to the OB/GYN,
the baby is in the third trimester,

173
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,675
孩子头太大，你妹的B太紧
its head is six inches wide,
your sister has a tiny vagina.

174
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,386
谁都说没事，没B事？
Everyone tells me to stop worrying.
I said, "Stop worrying?"

175
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,013
孩子的头要被 挤了
In labor its head is going to get crushed

176
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,806
也可能冲破你妹的B！
or it's going to blow out your sister's vagina.

177
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,099
不要在这里谈 B
Don't say the "V" word in the lobby.

178
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,184
我给你叔Marty打电话了
I called your Uncle Marty.

179
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,312
他说你家族的所有女性B都紧
He said all the women in your family
have teeny tiny vaginas.

180
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,606
我一直帮你，整整一个星期了
I've been covering your ass all week.

181
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,857
Simon 一直紧抓不放
Simon is breathing down my neck.

182
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,901
- 你丫的在干吗？ - 我太担心了
- What are you doing? - I'm worried.

183
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,320
你听到我说的没？Simon要开了你
Did you hear what I was saying?
Simon is going to fire you.

184
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,448
他怎么会开了我？我搞到红花了
Simon is not going to fire me today.
I got the red flowers.

185
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,532
红花
Red flowers?

186
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:54,658
对，中国人的新年
Yeah, it's Chinese New Year.

187
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,076
金女士马上就到了
Mrs. Jin will be down here any second.

188
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,996
中国人要 拜年，要红红火火
It's crucial the first thing she hears
be something positive.

189
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,206
她的一年运气全搭这上了
Her entire year depends on it.

190
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:10,249
[中文]祝你新年快乐，完事如意
Mrs. Jin.

191
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,636
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

192
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,809
你看到笑容了吗？
Did you see that smile?

193
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,396
您要见我？
Wanted to see me?

194
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,606
对
Yeah.

195
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,401
Fitzhugh 拒绝离开
Fitzhugh is refusing to leave.

196
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,237
我们从未赶任何人出去
We've never had a forced eviction at The Tower.

197
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,572
如果他们把Fitzhugh先生和家人撵到街上
If they drag Mr. Fitzhugh
and his family into the street,

198
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,740
对我们很不利
it's bad for all of us.

199
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,158
去和他谈谈
Why don't you talk to him?

200
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,451
你的职责，Josh
This is your responsibility, Josh.

201
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,286
银行早上要来人，把他弄出去
The bank comes in the morning.
Get him out.

202
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,714
Fitzhugh先生，我是Josh。
Mr. Fitzhugh,it's Josh Kovaks, sir.

203
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,182
早啊， Josh，你一个人？
Good morning, Josh.Are you alone?

204
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,267
恩
Yeah.

205
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,486
嘿，你有没看今天股市？
Hey, did you see what the market did today?

206
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,282
涨了106点，问我为什么会这样
Went up 106 points.Ask me why it did that?

207
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,366
为什么
Why?

208
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,660
我也不知道，但我曾经知道
I don't know,but I used to know.

209
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,412
这也是为什么Merrill Lynch雇佣我的原因
That's why they hired me at Merrill Lynch.

210
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,624
Fitzhugh先生，您知道这房子现在归银行了吧
Mr. Fitzhugh,you know this apartment
is now owned by the bank.

211
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,251
他们希望您能够即刻腾出来
They'd like you to vacate immediately.

212
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,128
我们给我们的孩子说，我们要
We told the kids that we were turning the apartment

213
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,879
把这里变成公园，绿色点
into a park. Going green.

214
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,798
为了解释为什么卖掉家具
That's how we explained all the furniture

215
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,259
还有这个帐篷
being sold and the tents in the living room.

216
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,846
幸亏孩子们太萌，就信了
Luckily, my children aren't very bright,
so they bought it.

217
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,890
但是他们的朋友很精
But they have smart friends and those friends
are catching on.

218
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,310
先生，明天银行就要来人了
Sir, the bank will be here tomorrow morning.

219
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,688
20年前，我在耶鲁，现在却成了无家可归
I went to Yale 20 years ago,
and now I'm a squatter.

220
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,401
等不及同学聚会了，“你好，我流浪汉”
Can't wait for their reunion.
"Hello, nice to see you.I squat."

221
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,486
其他家里人呢？
What about family?

222
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,324
我花光了全部的钱，他们不接电话了
No,I invested all their money.
They won't return my calls.

223
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,618
我本可以睡在车里，但是3月前车被收走了
I'd sleep in my car,but they repossessed
it three months ago.

224
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,245
所以，我不得不呆在这
So, you see,I have to stay here,

225
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,789
因为我没地方可去了
because we have nowhere else to go.

226
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,542
你现在是钉子户，算是非法的。
It's illegal for you to be here.
You're committing a crime.

227
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,002
我懂
I understand that.

228
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,426
我们明天会维修电梯
But we might be doing some elevator
maintenance tomorrow.

229
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,306
所以电梯明天可能会停运
I'm thinking that the elevators
will be shut down

230
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,478
然后银行的人可能明天暂时来不了
and those people from the bank will just have
to come back another time.

231
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,942
因为，你应该去试试
Because,it's like you go down one.

232
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,448
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

233
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,201
Shaw先生，这位是Mr. Dev'Reaux.
Mr. Shaw,I see you met Mr. Dev'Reaux.

234
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,245
这人拥有一座小岛和摩托艇，真酷哇
This guy owns his own island with jet skis.
How cool is that?

235
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,914
呃..这是我们的实习电梯员
He's our probationary elevator operator.

236
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,832
他还在观察期，没到面试阶段
He's still very early in the interview process.

237
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,335
为何不现在面试呢
Why don't we finish the job interview right now, Josh?

238
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,129
例如我问 给我一个汉堡包
Suppose I ask you to pick me up a cheeseburger,

239
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,506
你怎么回答？
Enrique,what would you say?

240
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,007
您想要什么风味的？
How do you like it cooked?

241
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,593
我只想要个法国布里奶酪
The thing is,I like a certain kind
of Brie on my burger,

242
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,221
但是只有乡下的Danny的奶酪店才卖
and they only sell it at Danny's Cheese Shop
downtown.

243
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,847
我马上去
I'm on my way.

244
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,475
还有牛肉不要有添加剂的
And the beef has to be grass-fed.

245
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,602
先生，纽约最好的屠户在Bleecker街。
The best butcher shop in New York is on
Bleecker Street, sir.

246
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,230
Josh，我要他
Josh, hire him.

247
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,025
好的，我也是这么想的
Yes, that was my gut, sir.

248
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,151
还有，有件事
And, Enrique,one other thing.

249
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,404
我想随时吃到我要求的汉堡包
I like to get my own burgers
whenever possible.

250
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,697
尽管在Belize（洪都拉斯），我还有自己的小岛
I may have my own private island in Belize,

251
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,700
但在内心，我只是个Josh这样的人
but deep down I'm just an Astoria boy like Josh here.

252
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,035
我们来自同一个地方
We come from the same neighborhood.

253
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,287
恩，就是，104号. Go Lions街
That's right,PS 104. Go Lions!

254
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,750
我的第一份工作是在Aqueduct赛道上扫马粪
My first real job was shoveling horseshit
at Aqueduct Racetrack.

255
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,544
别让我忘了这事
Don't you ever let me forget it.

256
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,878
不会的！
I won't, sir.

257
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,342
现在，去楼下，Rose那里拿些命名牌
All right, go downstairs
and get a nametag from Rose.

258
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,344
谢谢，先生。 谢谢
Thank you, sir.Thank you.

259
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,810
为何不今晚出动呢？Josh？ 搞点什么
Why don't we hit it tonight, Josh?
Raise some hell.

260
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,979
我们得在9小时内回来
We have to be back here in nine hours.

261
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,065
还记得你在时代广场酒吧跳舞时候吗？
Remember that time you danced on that bar
in Times Square?

262
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,442
我差点乐晕了
I almost fainted.

263
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,902
只是你6年前的一个醉梦而已
That's a drunken dream you had six years ago.

264
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,156
你在那里晃你的PP
You were shaking your ass up there
like Tina Turner.

265
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,450
在百老汇，半裸奔
Running half naked on Broadway

266
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,661
还给游客说你是狮子王里的Mustafa
telling tourists you were Mustafa
from The Lion King.

267
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,163
真荒唐，哪发生过
That's ridiculous.It never happened.

268
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,584
我本来不想告诉你，这是我任职的最后一年了。
I was waiting to tell you.
This is going to be my last year at The Tower.

269
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,668
神马？
What?

270
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,920
几个月后，我就要去圣地亚哥了
In a few months,I'm headed to San Diego

271
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,672
跟Lorraine过日子去了
to spend a little time with Lorraine.

272
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,884
我甚至会到世界各地讲各种 P笑话
I might even cruise around the world with
all the other old farts.

273
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,802
Wow.

274
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,556
真棒，真的很棒，我会想你的
That's great.That's really great.
I'm going to miss you.

275
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,558
我也会想你的，Josh
I'll be thinking about you, Josh.

276
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,976
车来了
Here's your bus.

277
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,312
想想你在那跳舞的样子
Be thinking about how you danced on that bar.

278
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,314
我全记在这了
Yeah!I got it all up here.

279
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,982
我不知道你从哪弄的这玩意
I don't know where you got that.

280
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,151
生命循环，Josh，生命循环
Circle of life, Josh. Circle of life!

281
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,619
虽然很少人会自己宰感恩节火鸡
Not many of you kill your own Thanksgiving turkey,

282
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,287
但你或许可以考虑下
but you might want to consider it.

283
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,831
操，Rita，赶紧死过来
Shit, Rita,get your ass back in here!

284
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,999
我才不会到处追你。
I ain't going to be chasing you all around.

285
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,167
再见，Slide
Goodbye, Slide!

286
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,919
嘿，Rita，现在可是大早上5点30
Hey, hey, Rita, come on now,it's 5:30 in the morning.

287
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,504
别闹了行不
Not little shit like this.Come on now.

288
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,130
我给你说了，我根本不认识个叫Maria的
I told you,I don't even know nobody named Maria.

289
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,882
就是就是，他咋就认识你呢？
Yeah, well,she sure as shit knows you, Slide!

290
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,966
那个号码肯定错了
It was a wrong number.

291
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,135
那他怎么知道你名字？ 为嘛？
Then why did she ask for you, stupid? Why?

292
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,929
肯定是打错了，只是..
It was a wrong number!I just...

293
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,515
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you are saying, bitch!

294
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,775
Lester，都15了，Shaw的车怎么还在这？
15.Why is Mr. Shaw's car still here?

295
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,859
他可能病了
Maybe he's sick.

296
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,198
那个黑车停在这2天了
That black sedan has been parked there for two days.

297
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,866
为什么没有拖走也没罚单？
Why no boot or ticket?

298
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,243
我给警察打了2次电话
I called the cops twice.

299
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,544
你还记得那天早上的抢劫案么
Do you remember that morning robbery

300
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,963
去年，在国家银行
at the International last year?

301
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,591
你现在把门锁上，疏散大伙
I want you to slowly lock the door
and clear the lobby.

302
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,760
冷静
Stay calm.

303
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,433
全锁好，关好门和电梯，黑色预警
Lock it down. Code Black on all
doors and elevators.

304
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,269
重复，黑色预警
Repeat, Code Black.

305
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,812
什么事黑色预警
What's Code Black?

306
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,398
开玩笑呢？上个月我们开会还说呢
Are you serious?
We talked about it at the meeting last month.

307
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,941
让我看看外面出什么事了
Let me see the outside of the building.

308
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,067
看样我我们要被抢劫了
I think we're about to be robbed.

309
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,152
4个人，带着枪
There were four guys out there with guns.

310
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,487
他们去哪了？
Where did they go?

311
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,155
我看看车库
Let me see the garage.

312
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,325
干洗店的人怎么在这？昨天不是洗衣日么？
Why is Stillman here?
Laundry pick-up was yesterday.

313
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,244
Shaw 让我们叫他来
Mr. Shaw asked us to call him.

314
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,162
有人把酒洒在他的桌布上了
Someone spilled wine on his tablecloth.

315
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,206
他马上就下来了
He's bringing it down right now.

316
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,667
这些人不是干洗店的伙计
Wait a second. Those are not the Stillman brothers.

317
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,338
他们绑架了Shaw
Oh, my God,they're taking Shaw.

318
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,923
这不是抢劫，这是绑架
This isn't a robbery,it's a kidnapping.

319
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,633
绑架，打110
It's a kidnapping!Call 911!

320
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,718
马上
Yes, sir.

321
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,844
黑色预警，Manuel
Code Black, Manuel!Code Black!

322
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,928
什么黑色预警？
What's Code Black?

323
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,307
Hey! Whoa!Whoa!

324
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,892
站住！
Hey! Stop!

325
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,148
射穿那些轮胎
Shoot at the tires!

326
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,608
我的是充电的！
I only have my Taser!

327
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
站住！
Hey, stop!

328
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,967
当心点！
Watch out!

329
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,473
进来 进来
- Move in! Move in!- Move in!

330
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,308
别动
Don't move.

331
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,894
举起手来
Get your hands in the air!

332
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,523
FBI，举起手来
FBI, show me your hands.

333
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,651
- 走吧 - 好了，完事了
- Let's go.- Okay, all right.

334
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,069
手背后！
Put them behind your back!

335
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,153
放松
Take it easy.

336
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,739
嘿，抓错人了，他是被绑架的。
No, get off him! He's the victim!

337
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,783
那是Arthur Shaw，住在我们那的
That's Arthur Shaw!He lives in The Tower.

338
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,243
他叫人洗东西，结果被绑架了
He was bringing his laundry down.They kidnapped him.

339
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,455
这不是绑架，这是逃逸。
This was not a kidnapping,it was an attempt to flee.

340
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,748
虾米？
What?

341
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,085
扣上他，把这人弄走
Arrest him and get him out of here.

342
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,463
Josh，帮个忙，把加热器关了，盖上泳池
Josh, do me a favor,turn off the heater
and cover the pool.

343
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,048
我不喜欢浪费钱
I hate to waste money.

344
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,014
华尔街的首脑Arthur Shaw
Wall Street kingpin Arthur Shaw,

345
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,725
福布斯富人榜上138位
number 138 on the Forbes 400 last year,

346
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,145
在今天逃逸过程中被拘捕
was arrested today in Manhattan while
trying to flee the city.

347
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,314
据说他将被控以
Sources have confirmed that he'll be charged

348
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,358
多项证券欺诈
with several counts of securities fraud

349
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,820
Shaw 的多处财产已被冻结
and an immediate asset freeze of Mr. Shaw's holdings
has been ordered.

350
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,155
Shaw 的律师进行的举报
Shaw's lawyers have called the arrest

351
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,324
另一个典型的华尔街追捕行动
"another example of the Wall Street witch-hunt,"

352
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,618
但是委员会的线人称这起诈骗
but sources at the SEC believe the fraud

353
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,413
将成为历史性的一点
in this case could be of epic proportions.

354
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,127
在这个国家，在判刑之前都是无罪的
In this country you're innocent until proven guilty,

355
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,505
所以，不管你听别人怎么说他
so no matter what you hear about Mr. Shaw
being a liar and a cheat,

356
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,258
或者他的生意怎么怎么样
or his entire business being some sort
of elaborate scam,

357
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,843
我们暂时还不清楚事情
we simply don't know the truth yet.

358
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,761
我还有鞋子没擦呢
I've got shoes to polish, Mr. K.

359
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,388
这跟我们有什么关系？
What does this got to do with us?

360
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,225
这6年，Shaw一直是这里的委员
For the last six years,
Mr. Shaw was on the board of The Tower.

361
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,644
那我们再去找个人当委员？
So we have to find a new board member?

362
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,104
不是
No.

363
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,315
几年前，在会议室
Several years ago at one of the meetings,

364
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,151
我们请他帮了一个忙
he was asked to do a favor for us.

365
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,111
他掌管了你们所有人的养老金
He was asked to manage all of your pensions.

366
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,195
养老金
Pensions?

367
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,488
是的
And he did.

368
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,532
虽然钱很少
He took us on even though it was
a small account.

369
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,992
但他同意接管了
He agreed to handle it.

370
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,994
谁让他这么做的？
Who asked him to do that?

371
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,331
我，Rose，我请求的
I did, Rose.I asked him.

372
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,211
那么还剩下多少钱？
Mr. K, what's left in the pension?

373
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,173
这事太突然，现在也没办法调查了
Kwan, all this just happened,so there's no way of knowing,

374
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,758
还有，这可能是个误会
and by the way,this could be a mistake.

375
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,177
多少钱？告诉我们
How much, Josh? Tell us.

376
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,514
现在，他们说
Right now, they're saying that anyone who

377
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,516
任何给Shaw的投资都是诈骗
invested with Mr. Shaw has been defrauded,

378
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,519
意思就是说，没了
and that more than likely,it's all gone.

379
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,271
没有养老金
There is no pension.

380
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,898
等下，等下，我想问
Wait, wait.Wait a minute.I'm sorry.

381
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,399
这是怎么回事？
How did this happen?

382
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,984
那人可是纽约最棒的人
The guy is the best in New York

383
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,903
而且他说他能让我们的投资翻3倍
and he promised he could triple our portfolio.

384
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,029
现在我们没钱了？
So they're going to get our money?

385
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,739
这家伙有上百万资产呢，对吧？
The guy had billions of dollars, right?

386
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,907
对，时间问题
Of course,it's just a matter of time.

387
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:41,620
所以我们只需要等待就行了吧，毕竟是我们的
So we have to stay patient and be positive,
because it has to be there.

388
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,663
我看新闻了
I heard on the news when they arrested Shaw

389
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,707
他的账户里只有600块钱
that he only had $600 in his checking account.

390
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,003
好吧，你们可能需要一段时间来接受事实
Look, some of you may need some time to 
process this.

391
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,129
如果有人想回家休息
If anyone wants to go home,

392
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,757
我会找一些人替代你们几天
I will call in a temp crew for the rest of the day.

393
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,051
我想这些明天就会见分晓了
I'm sure that this will all be cleared up tomorrow.

394
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,761
我能问个问题吗？
Can I ask you something, Mr. K?

395
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,845
说吧
Yeah.

396
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,597
他也拿了你的钱吗？
Did he get your money, too?

397
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,058
是的
Yeah, Odessa.

398
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,560
准确的说
For the record,

399
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,563
我还从没让任何人让我的钱翻倍过
I never asked anyone to triple my portfolio.

400
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,403
但几个小时前
Just an hour ago,

401
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,491
一个联邦法官刚宣布了1000万的保释
a federal judge released Arthur Shaw
on $10 million bail,

402
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:23,537
但仅允许他在中央公园的居所内
on condition he remain under house arrest
at his penthouse apartment

403
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,705
被软禁的情况下
on Central Park West.

404
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,998
Shaw，请发表份声明
Mr. Shaw, I need a statement from you.

405
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,041
退后
You need to back off.

406
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,377
说句话，Shaw
Can I get a comment please, Mr. Shaw?

407
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,712
退后，退后
You need to back off. Excuse me.

408
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,216
这儿！ 这！看这里！
Here!Over here! Come on, Shaw!
Right here! Shaw!

409
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,426
来笑一个，茄子！
Shaw, can we get a picture?

410
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,137
看这里！
Over here, Mr. Shaw!

411
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,061
我们正带领他和他的律师回到居所
We're taking Shaw and his attorney
up to the penthouse.

412
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,021
我需要Shaw的个人安全代码
I need Mr. Shaw's personal security code.

413
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,898
24719.

414
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:56,486
这是我小时候在施坦威大道的地址
That was my street address on Steinway Boulevard
in Astoria when I was a kid.

415
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,993
我的客户请求进入43号锻炼馆
My client would like access to the gym on 43.

416
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,246
即便是杀人犯也有15分钟的锻炼时间
Even serial killers get 15 minutes
of exercise a day.

417
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,290
他可以随时跳窗户
He has my permission to jump out the window.

418
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,668
软禁的条款很简单
The rules of Mr. Shaw's house arrest are simple.

419
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,921
未经FBI允许，不允许任何访客
Kovaks, no visitors without prior permission
from the FBI.

420
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,716
任何进出的邮件都要审查
All incoming and outgoing mail gets 
vetted by my office.

421
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,509
任何食物，包裹
All food deliveries, packages,

422
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,387
清扫，修理服务必须通知探员
cleaning, repairs, all that has to be cleared
by the agent on duty.

423
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,598
你要告诉你的员工，这里
You tell your staff that this penthouse is now

424
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,100
是最高安全监视区，而且会被守卫
a maximum security prison
and it will be guarded as such.

425
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,644
FBI将控制电梯和这层楼
The FBI is in control of the elevator
and this floor.

426
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,981
搞什么飞机？
What the hell is this?

427
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,778
1963年的法拉利250 GT Lusso,
Agent Denham,that is a 1963
Ferrari 250 GT Lusso,

428
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,282
曾被著名的Steve McQueen驾驶过
owned and raced by the coolest cat
who ever lived, Steve McQueen.

429
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,284
这曾是他的宝贝
This was his baby,

430
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,744
现在是我的
and now it's my baby.

431
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,956
你把车停在你的客厅里？
You got Steve McQueen's car
parked in your living room?

432
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,250
你还真是个 2B 老头
And here I thought you were an asshole.

433
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,127
10年前我花了1百万买到的
I paid a million for it 10 years ago.

434
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,129
翻10倍我也不会卖
I wouldn't sell it for 10 times that.

435
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,590
怎么把它搞出去？
We're 65 stories up. 
How do we get it out of here?

436
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,133
不可能
You don't.

437
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,344
这车是从零件组装起来的
This car was taken apart piece by piece

438
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,887
就在这里
and reassembled inside this room.

439
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,097
这车会在拍卖会上被卖掉
This car will eventually be sold at auction

440
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,724
跟你其他的东西一样
with the rest of your belongings.

441
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,061
前提是我有罪，但是我没有
Only if I'm guilty,Agent Denham,which I'm not.

442
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,025
如果你未经我允许，私自离开
If you leave this apartment for any reason
without my say so,

443
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,902
你将会被送给联邦看管
and you'll be remanded into federal custody

444
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,196
而且承担1000万的保释金
and forfeit $10 million bail.

445
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,698
你今天心情不错嘛
You have yourself a nice day, Mr. Shaw

446
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,326
跟我走走吧？
Kovaks, will you come with me?

447
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,827
帮个忙可以吗？
Josh, do me a favor, will you?

448
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,746
好的
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw

449
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,290
一定要亲自看好送来的食物
Make sure you handle all my food deliveries.

450
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,959
你还不懂，我是无罪的
You're smart enough to know I'm innocent.

451
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,753
I don't want the help to spit in my coffee.

452
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,005
They wouldn't do that, sir.

453
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,924
Yeah, but you
get it, right?

454
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,051
Do it as a favor to me.

455
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,305
Sorry, we don't
accept tips
at The Tower.

456
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,809
Right, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I forget
the rules.

457
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,567
Why did you let him
get away with that?

458
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,154
When he made that crack
about the help
spitting in his coffee.

459
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,824
You wanted to hurt him.
Hell, I wanted to hurt him.

460
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,994
Sometimes residents
say things they don't mean.
It doesn't faze me.

461
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,745
Either that or
you got no balls.

462
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,871
What?

463
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,790
I'm out of line.
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,333
I have balls,
all right.

465
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,043
I'm sure you got
big balls. Whatever.

466
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,462
I don't have to
defend my balls to you.

467
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,340
I'm just saying
the guy stole from everyone
who works in your building

468
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,842
and it looked like you
gave him a free pass.

469
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,802
Maybe next time I'll
rip out his larynx,

470
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,805
but today I chose to
do my job as manager
of this building.

471
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,182
Okay, my mistake, Kovaks.

472
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,727
Just that most
guys from your block
in Astoria

473
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:34,894
can't control
themselves.

474
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,313
And most girls
from Forest Hills
don't end up in the FBI.

475
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,690
That's where
you're from, right?

476
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,033
Here.

477
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,619
This is where most
white-collar crimes
are solved, the garbage.

478
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,872
When do you think
you will be getting
the money back?

479
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,124
I'm not really
allowed to discuss
the case with you.

480
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,126
But you're allowed
to clothesline me?

481
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,878
I was apprehending
a fugitive.

482
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,172
He's only a fugitive
if he's guilty, right?

483
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,339
Oh!

484
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,716
Aren't you
the loyal friend?

485
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,509
I never said
we were friends.

486
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,137
You play chess together,

487
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,139
you're the one
who asked him to
invest the pension.

488
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,517
I get his mail,
I open his car door,

489
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,644
I buy his cheese.
We're not friends.

490
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,354
Let me ask you something,
Kovaks.

491
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,607
If he's innocent,
where's the money?

492
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,775
How should I know?

493
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,695
The same way you knew
I was from Forest Hills.

494
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,030
You pay attention.

495
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,036
I just want to know
what I'm supposed
to tell my staff.

496
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,289
Is that too much to ask?

497
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,209
Tell them he's guilty.

498
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,545
Get on the car!

499
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,963
Hey! Hey, hey!

500
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,965
Come on,
put your hands
behind your back!

501
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,425
Come on, man,
what's this about?

502
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,469
This is bullshit! Shit!
That's police brutality, yo!

503
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,054
Come on now.

504
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,555
Man in the suit,
you seeing this shit?

505
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,099
You're my witness.
Take a cell phone picture.

506
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,642
Take a picture, man.

507
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,393
No, my cell phone
doesn't have a camera.

508
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,896
If you see Rita,
tell her I said
to call her brother.

509
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,648
Rita?
Yeah, her brother's
a bail bondsman.

510
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,816
Tell her I said
to use that money

511
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,526
I gave her to get
her teeth fixed.

512
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,486
Come on now,
what you got to be
pushing me like that?

513
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:17,205
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next Brooklyn bound

514
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,125
local train is now arriving.

515
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,919
Please step away
from the platform edge,

516
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:27,382
especially when
trains are entering
and leaving the station.

517
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,486
Hello.

518
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,823
Dr. Carr, dial 118, please.

519
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,536
Hey, what happened?

520
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,788
Lester tried to step
in front of
a subway train tonight.

521
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,666
An off-duty
traffic cop was there

522
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,334
and pulled him back
at the last second.

523
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,211
They have him on
a 48-hour hold.

524
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,337
Where is he?

525
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,979
If you wanted a sick day,
all you had to do was ask.

526
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,149
Seriously,
I need you
back at work.

527
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,776
I'm going to
tell the doctor
somebody pushed you.

528
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,528
It was a misunderstanding,
okay?

529
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,616
I gave it to him, Josh.
All my money.

530
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,743
I asked him to
invest it for me.

531
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,995
Shaw?
Yeah.

532
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:43,249
A couple of months ago,
I gave him everything I had,
my life savings.

533
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,834
Six years
working the back door

534
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:46,961
at the Waldorf,
nine at the Carlyle,

535
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,631
three at the Pierre,
11 with you at The Tower.

536
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,884
That's 29 years
of opening doors.

537
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,387
$73,000 and change,
and I gave him every penny.

538
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,099
In a few months
I won't have
money for rent.

539
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,602
I can't retire now.

540
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,357
All those years
of opening doors,
year after year.

541
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,987
Truth is, people can
open their own doors.

542
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,950
Not the way you do it.

543
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,205
Lester, he's going
to pay you back
every penny.

544
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,374
I promise.

545
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,628
Josh, please calm down.

546
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,712
Hold the elevator.

547
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,339
You can't go up there.

548
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,091
You're acting
like a vigilante.
Move your hand.

549
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,425
I won't move my hand.
Move your hand!

550
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,885
Relax. You're not
using your head.

551
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,303
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Josh.

552
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,429
Hey.

553
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,640
So, they're
evicting me
this morning.

554
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,725
My wife already
took the kids,
wants a divorce.

555
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,477
So, if you need me,
I'll be living in this box.

556
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,938
Can I ask you a question?
You're a Wall Street guy.

557
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,773
When did Shaw realize
that it was over for him?

558
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,651
Ten months,
maybe a year.

559
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,987
I heard he was
interviewing lawyers
over the summer.

560
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,364
So if he took
someone's money
a few months ago?

561
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,033
Probably needed the cash
to keep up appearances.

562
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,620
Throw his famous
Labor Day party
at the beach.

563
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,123
At a certain point,
it isn't about
securities fraud,

564
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,207
it's about catering.

565
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,922
Drop Mr. Fitzhugh on 59.

566
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,215
I'm going to the penthouse.

567
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,384
Wow! This is
going to be good.

568
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,264
Don't get up.
Whoa! Where do you
think you're going?

569
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,974
We're just going
to get the trash.

570
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,934
And the breakfast order.

571
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,269
Go ahead.

572
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,189
Takes a village.

573
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,489
Good morning,
Josh, Charlie, Enrique.
How are you doing?

574
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,742
How was your Labor
Day party this year,
Mr. Shaw?

575
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,369
Must have been something, huh?
What did you serve? Crab legs?

576
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,912
Surf and turf?

577
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:48,207
I've always tried
to extend you
a certain courtesy,

578
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,792
but this tone
you're using...

579
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,919
What tone? Who gives
a shit about my tone?

580
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,255
What are you,
some kind of
tone master?

581
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,883
Josh, come on.
I'm going to ask
you one time, okay?

582
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,760
So you better
think really hard.

583
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,428
Why did you take
Lester's money?

584
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:09,437
He came to me,
he asked me to invest
and I did. It was a favor.

585
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:13,107
Mm-hmm.
$73,000? A favor?
Everything he had.

586
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,901
Did Lester ask you
to come up here?

587
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,235
Mr. Shaw,

588
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,946
a few hours ago,
Lester stepped
in front of a subway train.

589
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,115
Oh, Jesus.

590
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,953
- Here we go.
- What are you doing?

591
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,540
Josh,
you need to listen to me.
The FBI is lying to you.

592
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,666
Josh, put down the club.

593
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,461
Christ's sake,
don't do anything
you can't undo.

594
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,091
Investing money is a gamble.
It doesn't always pay off.

595
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,051
Mr. Shaw, do you care?

596
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,469
Josh, come on.
No, really.

597
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,930
Do you feel any
responsibility for what
happened to Lester?

598
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,223
Of course I feel badly.

599
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,850
I had no idea
he was going to
lose everything.

600
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,311
Lester has been
a part of my life
for over a decade.

601
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,233
Then why haven't you
asked me whether
he's alive or dead?

602
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,071
Josh, this car
is irreplaceable!

603
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,823
Not like doormen!

604
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,325
They make new ones
of those all the time.

605
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,829
Must be 50 new doormen
coming off the line
in Michigan right now!

606
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,705
God damn it! Stop it!

607
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,582
Want some Brie
with your burger?
Here you go.

608
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,126
Josh, don't!
Shh!

609
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,961
Want me to come
work for you, huh?

610
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,462
Want to steal
me away to
Saint Bart's?

611
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,048
Come on, let's go!
I'm ready to rock!

612
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,384
Mr. Kovaks, let me have
a swing at that shit!

613
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,011
No! Nobody touches
this car but me.

614
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,348
You think Steve McQueen
is the coolest cat
that ever lived?

615
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,518
Guess what?
Today, Steve McQueen
is my little bitch.

616
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,565
Ooh!

617
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,358
Ah!

618
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,026
Oh!

619
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,446
Whoops.

620
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,202
Don't worry,
I'll have the help
come clean that up.

621
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,371
Let's go.

622
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,541
Josh, aren't you
forgetting something?

623
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,210
My breakfast order.

624
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,925
Do you understand
the shit-storm

625
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,260
that can be brought
down on this building?

626
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,180
Shaw's lawyer will
shove harassment,
destruction of property

627
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,640
and civil rights charges
right down our throats!

628
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,184
Now, I don't care
what Shaw did

629
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,977
or how much money
he's accused of stealing.

630
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,396
And you know damn well
I got murdered by that
son of a bitch!

631
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,815
But a line has been crossed,
and a gang of vigilantes

632
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,525
will not be tolerated
at The Tower.

633
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,735
You're all fired.

634
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,362
Hey, wait, hold on.
Mr. Simon, they had
nothing to do with this.

635
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,572
They just
followed me up there.

636
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,656
I don't give a shit!

637
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,575
Mr. Simon, wait a minute,
my wife is eight
months pregnant.

638
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,827
You should have
thought of that before you
walked in that apartment.

639
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,037
We went up there
for Lester!

640
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,872
Lester's job is
waiting for him
when he gets out.

641
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,042
Meanwhile, the rest of you,
I want you out of
the building right now.

642
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:59,899
Um, the carpet cleaners
are coming tomorrow,
they start on 44. Okay?

643
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,442
Bye, Joshie.

644
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,028
Good luck with the bar.

645
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,781
I don't know what
you're talking about.

646
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,581
All right.
Let's go, everyone.
Back to work, okay?

647
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,631
Hey, Charlie, wait!

648
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,383
Wait. I'll call Sasha,
all right.

649
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,467
I'll tell her you
tried to stop me.

650
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,719
Please,
don't do me any favors.

651
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,221
And, Josh,
don't pretend to care now,

652
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,931
I know you always
wanted to fire me.

653
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,392
That's because you
stink at this job.

654
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,019
So I stink? I stink?
Yeah.

655
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,522
The guy who made Mrs. Jin
smile on Chinese New Year?

656
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,482
Mrs. Jin is Korean.

657
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:42,900
She's what?

658
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,068
That's why she was smiling.

659
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,653
She's not Chinese,
she's Korean.

660
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,446
And you believed her?

661
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,282
Yeah, she's Korean.

662
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,493
All right, Josh,
maybe she's Korean.

663
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,328
Why are you whispering?
She is Korean.

664
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,831
What's important is
that she appreciated
the gesture I made,

665
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,958
and that's more
than I can say
for some people.

666
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,836
Thanks for getting me fired.

667
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,072
Hey.

668
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,532
Hey. Thank you
for coming down.

669
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,201
Yeah, no problem.
You got something
for me?

670
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,455
Yeah. I probably
shouldn't even be
doing this,

671
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,206
because it violates
everything I believe in,

672
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,626
but I have to
get my employees'
money back, so...

673
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,295
This is Shaw's
travel schedule
for the last 10 years.

674
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,922
It's his guest registry.
Names of judges, politicians,

675
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,924
women,
tail number of his plane,

676
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,718
hull identification
number of his yacht,

677
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,553
names of his race horses
in West Virginia...

678
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,888
Gill's Pride
and Sunny Day.

679
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,307
Yeah, we have
all that, Kovaks.

680
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,560
And eventually
they're gonna sell his
planes and his yachts,

681
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,521
and his horses,
and the bank is
going to take it all.

682
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,231
You guys were his
smallest account.

683
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,942
I'm sorry.

684
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,612
It's okay.

685
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,115
Thought I'd give it a shot.

686
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,911
Kovaks,

687
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,580
you wanna get drunk?

688
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:23,959
Thanks.

689
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,504
I've got to be
honest with you, Kovaks.

690
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:30,299
The last time
I drank this much at a bar
I made out with a fireman.

691
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,551
Really?
How long ago was that?

692
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,261
Tuesday.

693
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,640
You know,
you surprise me.

694
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:42,144
I saw the security tape
of you beating the shit
out of Shaw's car.

695
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,729
That was badass.

696
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,483
Yeah, well,
badass is my middle name.

697
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,860
Nope. Your middle
name is Marvin.

698
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,405
I know that from
your file. Marvin.

699
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,449
All right.

700
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,494
That's my dead grandfather
you're laughing at.

701
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,287
What else is in my file?

702
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,706
Oh.

703
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,417
I know the year your
parents got divorced.

704
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,377
Your SAT scores.

705
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,045
You don't know
my SAT scores.

706
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,964
540, math.
480, verbal.

707
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,300
I retook those.
Your scores went down.

708
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,432
I have to
tell you something,

709
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,892
and I really shouldn't
be telling you this,

710
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,895
because it violates
everything I believe in.

711
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,397
Mmm-hmm.

712
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,983
We still haven't
found Shaw's safety net.

713
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,779
All these guys,
they keep some cash close by
in case they have to run.

714
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,407
Shaw clears out
all of his accounts
three months ago,

715
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,534
20 million and change.

716
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,786
But when we bust him,
the money isn't on him.

717
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,163
Wait.

718
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,248
$20 million?

719
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,460
There's a chance we'll
get lucky and find it.

720
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,672
And if we get lucky,
maybe you can get lucky.

721
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,177
I'm not lucky.

722
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,429
You just have
to be patient.

723
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,891
I don't really have
time to be patient.

724
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,934
Well, if you're
tired of waiting around,

725
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,187
you can always try
the old-school approach.

726
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,354
What's that?

727
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,276
Grab some pitchforks
and a couple of guys
and storm the castle.

728
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,528
They'd never
see you coming.

729
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,655
I have to pee.

730
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,742
Ooh! I'm gonna...
I have to go.

731
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,118
Whoa, whoa.
You can't drive.

732
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,453
I'm gonna get a crab.

733
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,537
Crab?

734
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,124
Listen, you violated
three federal laws

735
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,834
when you beat up
Shaw's Ferrari.

736
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,836
So what?

737
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,839
So a lot of guys
down at the bureau
want to buy you a drink,

738
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,382
and so do I.

739
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,680
Bye.

740
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:43,474
Goodbye.

741
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,990
Manuel.

742
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,620
Sorry, Mr. K,
I can't let you
into the building.

743
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,872
No, no, I just have to
grab some stuff out of
my office, okay?

744
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,040
I promise
I won't attack anyone.

745
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,124
I can't do it.

746
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:14,463
Or should I tell
Mr. Simon about you
and the cougar in 2813?

747
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,342
Two minutes.
Okay.

748
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,719
Hi,
welcome to Shake Shack.
What can I get you?

749
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,178
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

750
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,181
Welcome to Shake Shack.
What's shaking?
We shake all day.

751
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,683
You like working here?

752
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,144
I cry at night.

753
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,980
You said you know
electrical engineering?

754
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,234
I'm on the phone
with the police.

755
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,737
They have a cruiser
in the area. Go away!

756
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,198
It's me, Mr. Fitzhugh.
Can you open the door,
please?

757
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,288
Hey.
Hey.

758
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,415
Why are you
staying in this motel?

759
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm thinking
of becoming
a male prostitute.

760
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,419
I think I might
have a better idea.

761
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,105
Sasha told me
you took a job.

762
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,900
Oh, yeah. I'm using
all the skills you
taught me as a concierge.

763
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,235
Thank you very much.
Hey, no spitting,
blue shirt.

764
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,321
Suck it,
douche bag!

765
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,739
It's not a bad job.
Only problem is

766
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,783
I need 40 hours to
get on the insurance,

767
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,035
it's hard to get shifts,
but if I don't get
on the insurance,

768
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,411
it's probably
gonna end up
costing us

769
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,455
around $20,000
to have the baby.

770
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,083
So we'll probably
have to sell it.

771
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,085
I need your help.

772
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,048
So you're saying you
wanna rob $20 million
from Arthur Shaw.

773
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,258
Which you think
he's hidden in
a secret wall safe

774
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,885
inside his
penthouse apartment.

775
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,512
An apartment
which he's not
allowed to leave

776
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,931
and is guarded by
three FBI agents,
24 hours a day.

777
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,015
Two.

778
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,266
And you wanna
do all of this
in a building

779
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,601
with the most
advanced security

780
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,019
and surveillance
system in the world.

781
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,647
A building which we've
all been barred from
ever entering again?

782
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,566
Yes. How do you
guys feel about that?

783
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,486
Well, I've really
enjoyed myself.

784
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,779
Thanks for the crackers.

785
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,906
Mr. Fitzhugh,
I know the money
is in that safe.

786
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,658
How do you know?

787
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,285
Because in 2003,
Shaw remodeled.

788
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,664
He spent like 10 million
to blow out the kitchen,
move the living room.

789
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,165
He even brought in
some guy from China

790
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,583
to do a whole
feng shui thing.

791
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,835
But he left
one wall standing,

792
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,378
dead center
in the middle
of the apartment.

793
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,754
That's where
he put the safe.

794
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,047
Maybe it's
a load-bearing wall.

795
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,799
No. No, it isn't.

796
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,092
We have the same
wall in my place.

797
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,844
We took it down
when we first moved in.

798
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,013
The FBI can't find
the money, because
he hid it in the wall.

799
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,264
I know it!

800
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,103
So you guys
in or out?

801
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,438
Mr. Fitzhugh?

802
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,274
Come back to me.

803
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,027
Mr. Dev'Reaux?

804
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,821
You know how many weeks
I'd have to work at the BK
to make 20 million?

805
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,157
18,600.

806
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,245
Charlie, come on.

807
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,706
Look at us.
We're basically waiters.

808
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,751
That's what we do.
We bring people stuff.
We don't take things.

809
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,419
You and I know
the movements
of every person.

810
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,087
We know the schedules,
deliveries and codes

811
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,213
for every door
and window.

812
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,716
We've been casing the place
for over a decade,
we just didn't know it.

813
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,384
We didn't know it,
because we weren't
doing it.

814
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,927
But we were.
No.

815
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,804
Okay, where do
the Lippmans keep
their passports?

816
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,723
In the freezer.
Mmm-hmm.

817
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,808
How many in
vitro fertilizations
did Miss Hansen have

818
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,560
before she gave
birth to Jonah?

819
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,103
Six.
See? We know everything!

820
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,980
What's the pass code
for Mr. Shaw's elevator?

821
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,025
I just press
the PH button.

822
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,403
Come on, man.
I need you.

823
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,572
Yeah, you need me,
because you've
got these idiots.

824
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,865
You think we're
getting our money back?

825
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,658
You think Lester is
getting his money?

826
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,410
I talked to the FBI.
It's gone!

827
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,871
So all this is
about getting it
back for Lester?

828
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,958
Yes! And Rose and
Miss lovenko and Manuel
and you, you jerk!

829
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,212
Come on! Let's storm
the castle together.

830
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,214
Oh, like when they went
after Frankenstein?

831
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,673
No, it's a different
kind of storming.

832
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,675
It's a storming
where the peasants
take everything back.

833
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,135
From like
the feudal lords and...

834
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,428
I'm in.

835
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,057
Holy shit! I'm in.

836
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,521
Well, now we're
undefeatable,
aren't we?

837
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,857
Josh, we're not criminals.
We don't know how to steal.

838
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,193
It's okay,
I know someone who does.

839
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,488
Crack four!

840
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,871
You must have been saying
your prayers, Slide.

841
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,039
You made bail.

842
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,962
Slide.

843
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,634
Thought you might
need a ride.

844
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,396
I haven't driven
my Nova for a few months.

845
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,191
Did you know that
in Spanish "No va"
means "It doesn't go"?

846
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,987
That's why they
didn't sell many
in Latin America.

847
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,992
I didn't realize Rikers
was on an actual island.

848
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,995
I thought
it was more of a...
I don't know, like a...

849
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,831
You know,
like the way Puget Sound
is actually an inlet.

850
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,332
But they...

851
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,794
You hungry?
Can I buy you some lunch?

852
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:48,672
Slide, what are you doing?

853
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,756
Tell me why
you bailed me out!

854
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,009
Take your foot
off the gas!

855
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,427
Answer the goddamn
question first!

856
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,595
Slide!

857
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,265
Red light!

858
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,440
All right,
what's going on?

859
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,566
You wearing
a wire or something?

860
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,775
Some kind of police
undercover shit?

861
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,152
No, I'm not a cop!

862
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,112
Then you brought me
out here for some
kind of freak shit, huh?

863
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,198
You want to
stimulate my nut sack.
Is that what it is, punk?

864
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,574
No! Jesus!

865
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,993
Then what the hell
we doing out here, man?
I don't even know your name.

866
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,995
I'm Josh Kovaks.

867
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,372
Man in the suit.
We talk almost
every morning.

868
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,957
How come you
bailed me out, man?

869
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,586
I need help with something,
and I thought
given our relationship

870
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,795
you might be
willing to help.

871
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,714
Relationship?
I ain't got no
relationship with your ass!

872
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,798
Our history!

873
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,383
What history?
I see you walking by
every now and then.

874
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,635
I say, "Hey, what's up,
little biatch?"

875
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,053
Just another
passer-by going by.

876
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,137
Just another
nigger walking by.

877
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,389
You don't remember 1971?
Mrs. Saltzburg?

878
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,142
We used to get dropped off
at her apartment every
morning for day care.

879
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,603
In 1971 I'm six!
How am I supposed to
remember some shit?

880
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,605
Come on, Darnell,
Mrs. Saltzburg!

881
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,690
Heavy-set German woman,
short goatee.

882
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,817
Man, you call me
Darnell one more time,
I will beat you to death.

883
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,736
You don't remember
Inch High, Private Eye?

884
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,446
Davey and Goliath?
Remember Witchiepoo?

885
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,281
H.R. Pufnstuf.
You got freaked
out by her?

886
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,407
Remember that
kid came over

887
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,993
and he stole my inhaler
and I couldn't breathe?

888
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,704
I do remember you!

889
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,082
You the little seizure boy
that was having them
seizures all the time!

890
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,250
No, I never had
any seizures!

891
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,668
They were minor
spasms of the throat.

892
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,378
And I remember
you would start
foaming up at the mouth

893
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,213
and your eyes
would go crooked.
It was very scary!

894
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,506
There was no foaming.
That was you!

895
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,341
A lot of people
have asthma
when they're kids.

896
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,260
It's not a big deal.
I outgrew it.
No. Seizure Boy.

897
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,470
You'd be on the floor
rolling all around.
You was having seizures!

898
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,056
Asthma doesn't cause
seizures, all right?

899
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,975
Oh, really? Then how come
nobody wanted to play
with your ass?

900
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,101
Nobody wanted to
have naptime with you,

901
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,435
nobody wanted to
do coloring with you
or nothing.

902
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,478
Because of your
little seizures

903
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,021
and didn't nobody
want to catch that shit!

904
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,523
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, punk.

905
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,024
Why did you bail me out?

906
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,986
Because I have a job
and I thought that
given your skill set

907
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,445
maybe you could
help us out.

908
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,072
What kind of
skill set is that?

909
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,034
Taking things that
don't necessarily
belong to you.

910
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,250
Oh, little Seizure Boy
want to try to
rob somebody, huh?

911
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,877
What you trying to steal?

912
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,463
$20 million.

913
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,217
Let's go get
something to eat.

914
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:08,353
Hey, guys,
this is my friend Slide.

915
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,814
You kidding, right?

916
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,317
These ain't the guys
you wanna try to
do this job with.

917
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,445
Yes, this is
Charlie and Dev'Reaux
and Mr. Fitzhugh.

918
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,654
This is a joke, right?

919
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:18,905
This guy is
the big time criminal?

920
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,990
Hey, what you say?

921
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,451
All right, guys,
take it easy.
He's totally qualified.

922
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,994
He's been arrested
a bunch of times,

923
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,079
he pays no income taxes,
he's got two
Doberman pinschers.

924
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,289
So let's show
him some respect.

925
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,458
So now we're like
The Doberman Gang?

926
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,584
Like the what?

927
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,503
It was a movie.
They trained Dobermans
to knock off a bank.

928
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,048
Is that the one
where Gregory Peck
was attacked by those dogs?

929
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,508
No, that's Boys from Brazil
with the cloned Hitlers.

930
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,552
Oh, shit. You guys ever
seen Boys Don't Cry?

931
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,721
When Hilary Swank
plays that dude.

932
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,097
That scared
the shit out of me.

933
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,933
Wait, Slide.
Sit down and talk
with us for a second.

934
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,643
These guys ain't
got what it take.

935
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:49,895
I can look in
their eyes and see it.

936
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,064
First sign of trouble,
they're gonna be
shitting in their pants.

937
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,607
They will not.
You don't know them.

938
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,108
You want me to prove it?

939
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,194
All right,
listen up,

940
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,821
y'all got 15 minutes
to go out there and
steal me something.

941
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:00,947
What do you mean?

942
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,158
You heard what I said.
In this mall, right now,
each one of y'all

943
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,660
go out there and
individually steal
$50 worth of merchandise,

944
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,413
come back and put
it on the table.
Then we'll talk.

945
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,584
Okay, 50 bucks,
no problem. Come on.

946
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,794
Can I go with you, Josh?

947
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,462
No, you ain't
going with Josh,
you go by yourself.

948
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,546
Everybody
going by theirself.

949
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,714
Anybody can't
handle this, is out.

950
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:18,924
Okay. Guys,
we can do this.

951
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,717
It's just shoplifting.
You got 15 minutes,
let's go.

952
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,719
And put your wallets
on the table. I don't
want nobody cheating.

953
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,222
I don't want y'all
to go buy the shit
and say you stole it.

954
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,474
All right, come on,
let's go.

955
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:38,485
This is a part
of our Sexy Little
Things collection.

956
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,906
Oh, yeah, that's great.
Love that. Yeah.

957
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,450
Would you like me to
ring that up for you?

958
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,204
No, I think I'll just
live with it a little first.

959
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,720
These are very
pretty Bella earrings.

960
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,681
They're from our
Timeless Collection.

961
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,891
Do you have any studs?

962
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,601
Yes, several.

963
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,061
Right here.

964
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,355
Do you have any hoops?

965
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:18,859
Sir, all of our earrings
are on this display.

966
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,487
Do you have a catalog?

967
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:23,572
Uh...

968
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,533
I might have
one in the back,
let me check.

969
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,293
How do those feel?

970
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,463
They feel a little tight.
Do you have them
in a half size up?

971
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,715
Yeah, let me
check the back.

972
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,106
Hey, them two
pairs of drawers
don't cost no $50.

973
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,236
$12 scented candle.

974
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,406
Okay, we'll get
to work tomorrow.

975
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,200
Wait a minute.
We all just
proved ourselves.

976
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,785
How do we know you can
really pull this off?

977
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,079
You each stole
$50 worth of shit,

978
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,122
I stole $264 in cash.

979
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,792
Rule number one,
never give your
wallet to a thief.

980
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,877
Later, bitches.

981
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,260
What are we
doing up here, man?
My balls are snow cones.

982
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,469
Can I get my jacket?

983
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,388
Everybody
shut up, right now.

984
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,978
In a robbery,
things can change quickly.

985
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,939
It can go from
hot to cold,
just like that.

986
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,025
You have to be
ready to adapt
to the situation.

987
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,236
You have to be able
to think on your feet.

988
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,155
I was on a job a few
days ago where my homie
got shot in the face.

989
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,490
He's kidding, right?

990
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,866
Get shot in the head,
it's over.

991
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,202
If you get shot in
your head, it's over.
If you get shot in your face,

992
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,371
the bullet will
go in your cheek,
then come out the other side.

993
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,789
Then what you
gonna do, sissy?

994
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,624
Die. I'm gonna die.

995
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,626
I saw a television show once

996
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:44,170
about a guy who
got shot in the head
with a nail gun.

997
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,880
He couldn't even remember
how to chew anymore.

998
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,382
He had to put
everything in a blender.

999
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,092
Yo, he couldn't
figure out how to chew,

1000
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,510
but he could
operate a Cuisinart?

1001
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:51,970
I don't think he
operated it himself.

1002
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,972
All right,
could we just focus, please?
It's 16 degrees!

1003
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,515
That's right!
Let's focus!

1004
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,933
Now, earlier today
I taught you all

1005
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,602
how to pick a lock
with a bobby pin.

1006
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,811
I want y'all to
practice on this door.

1007
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,397
I've got bobby pins
for all of y'all.
Here's your bobby pin.

1008
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,982
This is your bobby pin.

1009
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,900
Here's your bobby pin.

1010
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,820
This is your punk-ass
bobby pin. Take it!

1011
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:12,365
You unlock the door,
you won't freeze to death.

1012
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,536
I'm gonna be inside
having sex with Rita.

1013
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,540
Who's Rita?

1014
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:23,585
To get in the building,
we have to avoid
seven exterior cameras

1015
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,088
and six doormen who work
at two entrance points
in rotating shifts.

1016
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,549
Once inside,
we'll be faced with
four security officers,

1017
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,052
who monitor a bank of
12 internal cameras,

1018
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,762
as well as two
floating security guards,

1019
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,347
who vary
the patrol route each day.

1020
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,473
If we make it
through all of that,

1021
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,682
we still have to get
through this gauntlet

1022
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,392
of employees to
get to the elevators.

1023
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,477
Questions?

1024
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,479
Yeah. Who's that
girl in the red dress?

1025
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,147
She got
the kind of titties
I like to play with.

1026
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,399
That's Mary-Ann
from sales.
She's a lesbian.

1027
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,692
Okay, that's irrelevant.

1028
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:48,985
Mary-Ann
is a lesbian?

1029
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,862
She was married
when she sold me
my unit.

1030
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,031
She makes lesbian sex
with Lynn Rutherford
from accounting.

1031
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,325
Okay...
Lynn is a lesbian?

1032
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,534
Wait, I'm lost.

1033
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,828
How many lesbians total
do we have to avoid?

1034
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,497
None. We're not
avoiding lesbians.

1035
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,917
I don't avoid
lesbians at all.
I seek lesbians out.

1036
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,627
Lesbians got
the nicest titties.

1037
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,379
Straight women,
they have guys

1038
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,714
pulling and yanking on them
and sweating on them.

1039
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,217
Lesbians get
touched delicately
by other lesbians.

1040
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,593
It's nice.

1041
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,220
Did anybody take in
what I just said?

1042
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,138
Well, it seems like
there's a gauntlet
of lesbians.

1043
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,556
No. The...

1044
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,308
All right,
I'm just gonna keep going.

1045
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,983
1:27,
NYPD makes third pass
in front of the building.

1046
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,318
The parking
enforcement officer

1047
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,112
only works the west
side of the street.

1048
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,780
She got
a fat ass, too.

1049
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,198
All right, baby,
I'll call you
after lunch.

1050
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,533
I'm in a restaurant
with Josh

1051
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,910
and a couple of other guys
across from The Tower.

1052
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,912
Yeah. I love you.

1053
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,042
What are you doing?
It's supposed
to be a secret.

1054
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,045
I can't tell my wife
I'm having a lunch?

1055
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,756
We're not having lunch.
We're casing the front
of the building.

1056
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,341
Now they can trace
our steps back to us.

1057
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:54,968
I didn't tell her what
restaurant we were at.

1058
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,720
You said,
"The restaurant
across from The Tower."

1059
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,763
I didn't say
which restaurant
across from The Tower.

1060
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:01,933
Geez, a hamburger's $24.
We can't afford
to eat here anyway.

1061
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,561
Hey, we can order
whatever we like,
because

1062
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,730
Lunch is on me.

1063
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,944
This is the main
electrical room.

1064
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,405
You can override
the elevators from here
or shut them down completely.

1065
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,949
Mr. Dev'Reaux,
who took some courses
at DeVry Technical Institute,

1066
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,284
is gonna be our
point man on this.

1067
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,077
Online.
What?

1068
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,080
I went there to
go get my master's
in electronics,

1069
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,916
but somebody said,
"You got to go
to college first."

1070
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,210
I was, like,
"Yeah, it wasn't
in the brochure."

1071
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,756
Okay,
but you understand what...

1072
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,843
Absolutely.
I weld stuff and I'm,
like, you flip it on and off.

1073
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,178
It's all about power.

1074
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,933
Hey, man, how is this
supposed to be right
if you made it out of Legos?

1075
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,852
Well, the dimensions
are completely accurate.

1076
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,229
Yeah, who's this
little nigglet? Webster?

1077
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,648
Man, you might as
well use Lincoln Logs
or Tinkertoys.

1078
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,941
I got your ski caps.

1079
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,193
What?

1080
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,862
No, no, no.
Ski masks. Masks.

1081
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,031
Yeah, but the guy said
that these were
the warmest ever made.

1082
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,449
With pompoms?
You serious?

1083
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,577
You're such an idiot.
I need a mask.
It has to cover your face.

1084
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,330
Josh, let's say
we get the money

1085
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,831
and make it outside,
then what?

1086
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,417
Slide is the only one
with no connection
to The Tower.

1087
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:11,294
So he's agreed
to hold the money
for a week.

1088
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,421
Are you crazy?
You're gonna give
this guy $20 million?

1089
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,464
He's a crook!

1090
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,966
What you say?
Say it again.
I didn't hear shit.

1091
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,593
- Speak into the microphone!
- Hey! Hey!

1092
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,844
Why don't you
say it again, punk?

1093
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,429
Come on, Slide, no guns.

1094
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,264
You running
things now, huh?

1095
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,766
Man in the suit got
it all figured out?

1096
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,518
No, man in the suit
doesn't have it
all figured out,

1097
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:27,977
but man with the gun
needs to understand

1098
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,938
what man in the suit
is trying to accomplish
here, all right?

1099
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,022
Why you talking like that?

1100
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,233
You were talking like that!
Why can't I talk like that?

1101
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,360
What you think,
this is a joke, Josh?
We gonna just walk in there

1102
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,278
and roll this dude
for $20 million
without a fight?

1103
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,156
Look, no guns.
End of story,
all right?

1104
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,908
What if we run into
some shit in there
we don't expect?

1105
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,493
Trust me,
there won't be
any surprises.

1106
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,377
It's the FBI lady
and two cops.

1107
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,379
Shit! We haven't
done anything yet.

1108
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,673
We're plotters.
We've plotted.
That's a crime, right?

1109
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:57,799
Is that a crime?

1110
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,883
Everybody, just relax.

1111
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,343
You relax!
I'm out on bail.

1112
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,178
I'm gonna go
in the closet.
I'm coming with you.

1113
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,972
Guys, it's okay,
I think she's here
for me.

1114
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,139
Go find
your own spot.

1115
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:12,397
Hey, Agent Denham,
what a surprise.
What's with the police?

1116
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,440
Josh, Arthur Shaw
is gonna walk.

1117
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,401
What?

1118
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,736
The judge is
gonna dismiss the case
next week at his hearing.

1119
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,154
They're acting
like he's untouchable.

1120
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,740
That's it? He just
gets away with it?

1121
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:23,825
That's not it.

1122
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,035
He's threatening
to press charges
against you.

1123
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,079
He wants you to
answer for the Ferrari.

1124
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,455
So they're here
to arrest me?

1125
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,125
He says he'll
drop the whole thing
if you apologize.

1126
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,459
A sincere apology,

1127
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,545
that's what Shaw wants.

1128
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,796
And if I don't do it?

1129
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,591
Then these gentlemen
will read you your rights.

1130
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:02,071
You know what's considered
the greatest move in
the history of chess, Josh?

1131
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,907
A man named
Frank James Marshall

1132
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,576
was losing to a man
named Levitsky in 1912,

1133
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,578
world championship
in Helsinki.

1134
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:13,917
And it looked like
Marshall had no chance
until he moved 23 queen G-3.

1135
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,419
He deliberately
sacrificed his queen

1136
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,630
and the move
was so shocking
and surprising

1137
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,798
that Levitsky
never got over it.

1138
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,426
He lost the game
two moves later.

1139
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:28,056
And the move became known
in the annals of chess
as the "Marshall swindle."

1140
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,479
I'm a very good
chess player,
but I'm no swindler.

1141
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:38,983
What you did to my Ferrari
was the move of a small man.

1142
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:42,987
But now it's my move,
and I'm not sure how
I want to play this.

1143
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,033
All I'd like
to say, Mr. Shaw,

1144
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,285
is someday
I'm gonna find a way
to make things right.

1145
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,120
I don't care
what I have to do,

1146
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,497
I will find
a way to pay you back

1147
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,915
for everything
that has been done.

1148
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,086
Good, because I know
how difficult it
must be for you

1149
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,630
to lose a service job
like this at your age.

1150
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:05,134
And one day when all
this is ancient history,
I hope you can come back,

1151
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,970
maybe not as a building
manager at first,

1152
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,889
but somewhere where
you can start over,
earn our trust.

1153
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,391
A doorman,
for instance.

1154
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,396
Now go home
and practice
your chess game.

1155
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,732
I'll study
the "Marshall swindle,"
sir.

1156
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,944
Anybody can sacrifice
their queen, Josh.

1157
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,531
The real trick is
getting away with it.

1158
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:34,664
Thanks for the ride.

1159
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,541
Any time.
Oh, God, wait a minute,

1160
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,918
before you go,
this is for you.

1161
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,337
It's a present.

1162
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:43,673
It's the footage of you
beating the shit
out of Shaw's car.

1163
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,259
I took it from
the security camera
in his apartment.

1164
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,095
You committed
larceny for me?

1165
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,181
Let's just say,
I misplaced three
minutes of footage.

1166
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,309
Thank you.
I'm touched.

1167
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,687
You're welcome.
Okay.

1168
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,780
Are you working
on Saturday night?

1169
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,365
I'm always working.

1170
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,700
Call in sick.

1171
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,620
You're asking
an FBI agent to lie?

1172
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,290
I'm asking an FBI
agent to dinner.

1173
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,169
I'll see you
Saturday night.

1174
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,503
Good.

1175
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,303
What the hell is that
in your hand?

1176
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,764
It's a present.

1177
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:33,973
She gave you
a present?

1178
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,349
I don't know
about the other guys,

1179
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,560
but I don't want you
seeing the federal agent
anymore.

1180
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,062
I'm not seeing her
until Saturday night.

1181
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,521
Oh, my God!
He's dating her.

1182
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,441
Relax, my social life
and my criminal life
are totally separate.

1183
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,776
They're not separate
if you're dating

1184
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,819
the FBI agent who
busted Arthur Shaw!

1185
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,821
Shouldn't we be
avoiding law enforcement?

1186
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,656
I never saw
an episode of Matlock

1187
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,492
where the criminal
banged Matlock!

1188
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,786
Well, it don't matter.
Is this the safe?

1189
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,412
Yeah.

1190
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,498
Then we have a really
serious problem.

1191
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,878
You saying
you can't open it?

1192
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,047
No, I'm saying
I never worked on
a safe like this before.

1193
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,381
I usually break
into strongboxes.

1194
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,342
You never said
it was a real safe
made out of steel.

1195
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,927
We're going after
$20 million.

1196
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,011
What did you think
it would be? Wood?

1197
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,971
What kind of thief
can't open a safe?

1198
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,681
Well, generally
I rob balconies.

1199
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,600
Balconies?
Like a cat burglar?

1200
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,477
That way I never get
charged with breaking
and entering.

1201
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,145
And I never steal
nothing over $1,000,

1202
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,189
because in New York
that shit is a felony.

1203
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,108
What do you get?
Like potted plants?

1204
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,276
No, bitch!
I don't be stealing
no potted plants!

1205
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,112
I steal mostly
satellite dishes.

1206
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,405
I got a friend of mine
who be hooking up
illegal DirecTV.

1207
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,324
Hey, can your friend
hook me up?

1208
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,951
No!
This is a bunch
of horseshit.

1209
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,327
Your thief isn't
even a thief.

1210
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,496
Hang on a sec.
You can figure
this out, right?

1211
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,248
No, I can't
figure this out.

1212
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,458
I'm serious.
You have to find
a actual safe-cracker.

1213
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:43,793
Where am I gonna
find a safe-cracker?

1214
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,920
I don't know.
You have to start
thinking outside the box.

1215
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,924
Shit, you got to find
somebody with some
safe-cracking history. Think!

1216
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,554
So, Odessa,
I think we should address
the elephant in the room.

1217
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,973
What the hell
you just call me?

1218
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,642
No, no.
I'm talking about
the anger you have for me.

1219
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,018
How you blame me for
losing the pension,

1220
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,020
which is the last thing
I ever wanted to happen.

1221
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,815
I know you're
a good man, Mr. K,

1222
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,441
even though you
ruined my life.

1223
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,193
Which is why
I invited you here.

1224
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,028
When I hired you,
I made a note that

1225
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,655
you worked for your
father in Kingston.

1226
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,906
He was a locksmith.

1227
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,658
Yes, the best in Jamaica.

1228
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,742
Uh-huh.

1229
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,870
Did he teach you
how to open locks

1230
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,580
and doors and
things like that?

1231
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,999
There ain't no lock
I can't get by, Mr. K.

1232
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:28,504
I was just wondering,
do you think you
could open this thing?

1233
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:32,008
That safe has
a six-number wheel pack
with a double-action fence.

1234
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,051
Very tricky spindle.

1235
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,970
Probably take me
15 minutes to open.

1236
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,473
Fifteen minutes?
Could you show us?

1237
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,602
What's in it for me?

1238
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,523
2:42,
Lester at his post.

1239
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,112
Couple of NYPD officers
at the falafel cart.

1240
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,825
Wait a second.

1241
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,785
That's Charlie.

1242
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,456
What's Charlie doing here?

1243
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,751
Yeah, why is Charlie
going into The Tower?

1244
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,593
What did you do?

1245
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:19,889
I went to talk to Mr. Simon.
He called me,
said he had a job for me.

1246
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,808
He wants me to be
the building manager.

1247
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,144
He asked you to be
the building manager?

1248
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:28,231
Yeah, he offered me
your job, so I took it.

1249
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,775
That's ridiculous!
You're not qualified.

1250
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:34,278
But it's not ridiculous
for you to rob $20 million?

1251
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,405
I can't believe
how irresponsible
you're being!

1252
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,532
You really think
that you're gonna
just stroll in there

1253
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,576
like Robin Hood
and his band
of merry doormen

1254
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,787
and outsmart the guys
with ear pieces and guns?

1255
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,872
Why is that so hard
for you to believe, huh?

1256
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,874
Why can't you just be
my skinny Friar Tuck?

1257
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,793
Come on!
Who's Friar Tuck?

1258
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,128
Friar Tuck is the guy
who helps Robin Hood!

1259
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,297
I can't do this, Josh.

1260
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,634
You put one foot
inside The Tower,
I'm gonna call in a Code Blue.

1261
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,219
It's black.
It's Code Black!

1262
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,929
You call it black,
I call it blue.

1263
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,683
Maybe I made up new codes,
because I'm in charge
of The Tower now.

1264
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:07,228
I'm warning you, Josh,
come near, it's a
Code Blue-Black.

1265
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,528
First thing you do,
you have to find
the entry point.

1266
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,990
You have to use
your fingers when you
find the entry point.

1267
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,868
It's all in the touch.

1268
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,579
You married?

1269
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,499
Say what?
You married?

1270
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,378
No, I ain't married.

1271
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,714
What's up?

1272
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,133
Just taking a poll.

1273
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,342
Taking a poll?

1274
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:40,219
I'll take your poll.

1275
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,309
Why did you
call me here?

1276
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,810
I got a call
two hours ago

1277
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,520
from Judge Hollingsworth's
clerk.

1278
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,981
They're moving
Arthur's court date
up to Thanksgiving.

1279
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,065
Thanksgiving?

1280
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,234
The judge wants to avoid
a media circus on this,

1281
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,320
let him walk as
quietly as possible.

1282
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,280
It's an act of contrition.

1283
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,948
By the way,
Agent Denham,

1284
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:04,243
I'll be pressing
charges against Josh
and all his accomplices

1285
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,037
the moment
I step out of court.

1286
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:09,332
Come on,
he did what you asked,
he apologized.

1287
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,710
It's time everyone
paid for their mistakes.

1288
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:14,795
I agree.

1289
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:21,302
Hello.

1290
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,970
There's something
that you need to know.

1291
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:27,391
They moved Shaw's court date
up to Thursday,
and he's coming for you.

1292
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:28,893
You'll be in jail
by the weekend.

1293
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,228
That really messes up
our plans, doesn't it?

1294
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,816
Josh, you need to
get yourself a lawyer.

1295
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:37,818
Take care.

1296
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:43,449
Great news,
it worked.

1297
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,118
We're good
for Thanksgiving.

1298
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,547
My sister will be
taking the Q train

1299
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,007
to my uncle's
house in Brighton.

1300
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:01,425
She cooks for him
every year.

1301
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,052
How am I gonna know
what she looks like?

1302
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,470
Here.

1303
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,971
Got it.
Okay.

1304
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,232
"I know some of you
believe I'm the reason

1305
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,693
"Paul McCartney didn't
buy an apartment here
in 2008.

1306
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,070
"Maybe I did get
a little confused

1307
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,322
"about the meaning
of the word 'wanker.'

1308
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:26,325
"Maybe you heard about
the Mrs. Jin incident.

1309
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,620
"I know that I'm
not Josh Kovaks.

1310
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,415
"But today
I am your leader.

1311
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:35,376
"And today is Thanksgiving,
the toughest day of
the year for The Tower.

1312
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,712
"Forty-three parties,
close to 500 guests,
30 caterers,

1313
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,215
"all of Garage 2
blocked until 4:00.

1314
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:44,260
"Today, you might say,
is our Super Bowl.

1315
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:48,055
"Today, you might say,
we will not lose."

1316
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,143
Booyah.

1317
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,832
The start of
Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade
is just moments away.

1318
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,334
Three million people
will line the streets
of this city.

1319
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,336
Fifty million more
will watch from homes

1320
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,839
all across the country
and around the globe.

1321
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,800
When the parade begins,
all eyes turn to the sky

1322
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,137
as the largest
balloons in the world
soar above this city.

1323
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,223
It's a sight that
brings out the child
in all of us.

1324
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,954
Hey, Josh,
here's your sister's phone.

1325
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:54,997
Great.

1326
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,457
She's really hot,
by the way.

1327
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,930
Watch your head,
Shaw 先生

1328
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,308
Where's Slide?

1329
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,684
He's supposed
to be here.

1330
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,027
They're on the move.

1331
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,113
Wait a sec.

1332
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,659
- Oh, God.
- What?

1333
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,410
What is it?
It's Slide.

1334
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,620
Is he coming up here?

1335
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,539
- Shit!
- What is he doing?

1336
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,623
He's wearing my suit.

1337
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,458
He stole my suit.

1338
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,086
He's heading
for The Tower.

1339
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,587
Well, that's not the plan.

1340
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:45,798
How do you forget a plan?
Didn't he write it down?

1341
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:46,882
He didn't forget it.

1342
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:48,384
All that time he
spent with Odessa,

1343
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,802
he thinks he
can open the safe.

1344
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,970
I don't understand.

1345
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,388
He's going for the money.

1346
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:53,973
Didn't I tell you
he would screw us?

1347
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:55,808
What are we gonna do?

1348
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,227
We stick to the plan.

1349
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,145
We go on Snoopy.

1350
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,735
Holy shit!
You guys are not
gonna believe this.

1351
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,029
That girl that
moved into 4811?

1352
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,906
She's in French
Playboy this month.

1353
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:14,326
And in French Playboy,
they're even more naked.

1354
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,663
Mrs. Goshen is looking
for a Turkish loose tea,

1355
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,999
an orange pekoe
or mint melody.

1356
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,751
Well, just send her
an assortment, Rose.

1357
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,588
"I'm at Lenox Hospital,
my water broke."

1358
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:29,300
It's happening.
Rose, cover for me.

1359
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:30,926
I'm having a baby.
I'm having a baby!

1360
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,094
Excuse me.
I'm having a baby.

1361
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,001
Guys, check it out.
Snoopy.

1362
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,961
I like Snoopy.

1363
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,713
Yeah, it's Snoopy.

1364
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,007
- Snoopy!
- Snoopy!

1365
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:26,190
It's Huang's birthday!
Everybody come and sing.

1366
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:28,734
Ron, Manuel,
come and sing.

1367
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,362
Come on, everybody.
Everybody come on,
come on now.

1368
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:32,863
Everybody come on now.

1369
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,663
So what happened
to Mr. Larkin?

1370
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,164
We had to fire Mr. Larkin.

1371
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,041
He was involved
with some illicit
sexual behavior

1372
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,085
that we at Chase Manhattan
just will not tolerate.

1373
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,295
If you wanna wear
a black leather hood
and whip your own ass,

1374
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,339
work at Bank of America.

1375
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,134
So you'll be taking
over his account,
Mr. Davis?

1376
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:56,136
Yes, I will.
Working holidays?

1377
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,846
We've been very
patient with you

1378
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,849
with regard to
the Fitzhugh foreclosure,
but the bank is ready to sell.

1379
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,685
And we'd like to
personally offer you
a finder's fee

1380
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,353
if we can move
the remodel along.

1381
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,938
A finder's fee?
Mmm.

1382
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,357
We just started
demolishing
the apartment.

1383
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,566
The place is gonna
look like new.

1384
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,694
It's going to be
one of the finest
units of the building.

1385
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,195
I'd love to see it.
Can I see it?

1386
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,864
Here you go.
There you go.

1387
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:33,006
Well, looks like
the staff is having
a little party.

1388
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,102
We were supposed to
be in that elevator.

1389
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,437
Come on.

1390
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,692
We have to go up.
Let's go.

1391
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,652
All the way
to the top?

1392
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:58,866
So, as you'll see,
this entire apartment
is being redone.

1393
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,785
All new appliances.

1394
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,413
Floor-to-ceiling windows.

1395
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,914
Hardwood floors.

1396
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,583
Oh, hardwood floors.
That's nice.

1397
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,084
Tell me,
are you gonna do
the closets over?

1398
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:10,252
Yes, right this way.

1399
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,336
Oh, yes. This way.

1400
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,089
This is the master
bedroom closet.

1401
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,758
It'll have new
sliding racks.

1402
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,761
And what beautiful doors.
Are these doors
made of mahogany?

1403
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,930
- Mr. Davis?

1404
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,349
Excuse me, Mr. Davis.
I'm locked in the closet.

1405
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,227
Hello?

1406
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,389
Sorry, no cleaning now.

1407
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,642
It's okay,
I'll come back.

1408
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:07,893
Do you want some cake?

1409
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,645
We're celebrating
a birthday downstairs.

1410
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,729
No, thank you.

1411
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:12,773
It's amazing cake,
are you sure?

1412
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,650
I'm allergic to chocolate.

1413
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,610
I break out in hives.
I can't touch it.

1414
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,162
Bumbaclot!

1415
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,166
You should have
tried the cake, man.

1416
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,272
Odessa,
did he take the cake?

1417
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:56,149
He's allergic to chocolate.
I had to beat him.

1418
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,391
Oh, shit.

1419
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:30,726
The maid has gone rogue!

1420
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,811
Put him in the chair.

1421
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,656
Very spacious.

1422
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,178
Got it! Come on.

1423
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,709
Yeah.

1424
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:42,464
This is incredible.
Yeah.

1425
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,717
I have to hand it
to you, Mr. Kovaks,
you were right.

1426
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,719
Move away
from the safe.

1427
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,973
I ain't gonna
say it again.
Back up!

1428
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,308
Are you serious?
What are you doing?

1429
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:54,559
Hey, Josh, I'm a thief.

1430
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,645
I keep telling you
I'm a thief, but you
don't want to believe it.

1431
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,563
I know exactly what I am.
You're the one
that's confused.

1432
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,149
Now back up
before I pop a cap
in your ass.

1433
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,234
No.

1434
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,152
No?

1435
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:05,278
Yeah, no.

1436
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,156
Look at my face.

1437
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,449
You see how serious I am.

1438
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:10,826
I'm pretty serious, too.

1439
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:11,952
Are you ready
to die, bitch?

1440
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,203
That's my suit.

1441
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,289
Yeah, I got on your
suit and your drawers
and socks, too! So what?

1442
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,416
I want my suit back.

1443
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,794
I will blow your face
clean off your face!
Now, back up!

1444
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,171
You think I'm gonna
let this shit get away?

1445
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,923
You don't
have a choice.

1446
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,466
I brought my own gun.

1447
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,635
Now put your shit down,
nice and slow.

1448
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,977
You mess with me,
you're a dead man.
Now drop it!

1449
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:38,145
Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

1450
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,479
I'm putting it down
right now.

1451
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:41,189
Take it easy.

1452
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,404
On the ground,
you punk-ass bitch!

1453
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,698
Bitch, on the ground!
We had a plan!
Take it easy.

1454
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,867
We had a plan!
Fitz, calm down.

1455
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,368
Come on now. Shit!
Fitz, take it easy.

1456
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:54,703
Be cool with the gun, man.
Okay. All right.

1457
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:55,746
Relax.

1458
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,748
I'm relaxed,
you relax!

1459
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,586
You sissy... You bitch!

1460
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,642
Ladies and gentlemen,
America's queen of comedy,

1461
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,311
Joan Rivers.

1462
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,980
And here's Kanye West.

1463
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,816
Charlie,
what are you doing back?

1464
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,985
Rose, please.
I feel like my
head's gonna fall off.

1465
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,738
I raced over to the hospital,
she's not there.
I can't find her.

1466
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,114
I get into
an argument
with 15 doctors.

1467
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,075
I said, "Where's
my wife?" They said,
"Your wife's not here."

1468
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,242
I called my Uncle
Marty in Brighton.

1469
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,368
I say,
"You got to
get over here.

1470
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,661
"She's not here.
Nobody can find her."

1471
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:37,788
He said,
"What do you mean
no one can find her?

1472
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,414
"She's in the television room,
watching television."

1473
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:41,041
I said, "Are you kidding me?
Put her on the telephone."

1474
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,084
He puts her
on the telephone.

1475
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,877
I said, "What are you doing?
Your water didn't break?"

1476
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,462
"No." "Your vagina's
not dilated?" "No."

1477
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,630
I said,
"Why did you send
me a text message?"

1478
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:50,884
She says, "I didn't
send you a text message.
I can't find my phone!"

1479
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,386
Have you seen Josh?

1480
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:58,058
Manuel,
will you show me
the penthouse hallway?

1481
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,021
These FBI guys
are always falling asleep.

1482
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,649
Where is Mr. Simon?

1483
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:09,277
He was showing
Mr. Fitzhugh's old
apartment to some guy.

1484
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,241
Manuel, do you think
something strange
is going on?

1485
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,786
They cut Miss Piggy
from the parade.

1486
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,704
I think that's strange.

1487
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:30,882
Well, it's been
nice meeting you,
Agent Denham.

1488
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:34,928
You know, I'm still trying
to decide if I should
go after your badge.

1489
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,722
Either way,
no hard feelings
on my part.

1490
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:41,685
Maybe we could
have dinner sometime,
my treat. Huh?

1491
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,989
Can I help you?

1492
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,907
We have a meeting
with Judge Hollingsworth.

1493
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,409
Judge Hollingsworth
is down in D.C.

1494
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,703
He goes down every year
to spend the holiday
with his daughter.

1495
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:00,829
Are you sure?

1496
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,831
There's no one
here today, ma'am.
It's Thanksgiving.

1497
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,833
What the hell
is going on?

1498
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:05,959
Back in the car.

1499
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,502
Wait, no.
Wait a second.
Back in the car.

1500
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,087
Wait a minute!

1501
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,093
Three, four, five,

1502
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,679
six, seven, eight.

1503
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,934
You open it, Mr. K.

1504
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:32,861
Wow.

1505
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,154
Oh, my God.

1506
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,656
This can't be real.

1507
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,287
Empty! After all
this shit, it's empty.

1508
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,164
Man, what kind of...

1509
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,166
Give me my gun back.

1510
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,001
This is over.
Give me my gun...

1511
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,003
I might need it
to get out of here.
I'm not giving it to you.

1512
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,047
Stop bullshitting
and give me the gun.
No! I don't want to.

1513
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,673
Give me the goddamn gun!
Fitz, give him the gun!

1514
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,800
Give him the gun!
Guys. Guys!

1515
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,135
What the hell is
wrong with you, man?

1516
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,386
You gonna kill
somebody in here!

1517
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,555
- Sorry.
- What the hell, man?

1518
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,314
Give me that crowbar.

1519
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,776
- What?
- Did you find something?

1520
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:20,242
What is that?
Gold.

1521
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,327
- Real gold?
- Holy shit.

1522
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,205
The hood is solid gold.
Do you have any idea
what that's worth?

1523
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:29,000
It's not just the hood.
It's the whole car.

1524
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:31,211
This is where
he hid the money.

1525
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,298
This car must
weigh 2,000 pounds.

1526
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:38,093
Sixteen ounces to a pound,
that's 32,000 ounces.

1527
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:41,471
The current price of
gold is $1,872 per ounce.

1528
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,641
Josh, it's about
45 million.

1529
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,893
- Jesus!
- $45 million?

1530
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,853
Give or take 10 million.

1531
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,273
Give me that crow bar.
I am going to break
a chunk off this bitch.

1532
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,607
Are we going
to chop it up?

1533
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,359
How we gonna do that?

1534
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:56,444
Why don't we take
the whole thing?

1535
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,570
What?

1536
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,864
What are we gonna do?
Roll it out the front door?

1537
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,032
It's not gonna fit.

1538
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,076
It is too big.
It won't go
through the door.

1539
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,119
Man.

1540
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,288
And the doors in
Fitzhugh's apartment
are torn out.

1541
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,164
Too bad it is
six floors down.

1542
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:09,666
Shit!

1543
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,461
How much you say
it weighs?

1544
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,574
It has to be green,
because green means go.

1545
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,248
It's moving.

1546
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,424
This is crazy.

1547
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,933
Josh, this is really crazy.

1548
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,065
Okay, all right.

1549
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,441
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1550
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:21,112
All right.

1551
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,535
Hey, do you know
of any reason

1552
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,871
somebody would
want you out of your
penthouse right now?

1553
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:31,998
No.

1554
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,378
Mr. Shaw, I think
you're being robbed.

1555
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:46,596
This is a bad idea.
Really? Which part?

1556
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,680
The part where
you screw us over

1557
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:49,099
and try to take
everything for yourself?

1558
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,809
Even when you were
six you couldn't share.

1559
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,227
Maybe I just
didn't want to share

1560
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,561
with your silly
seizure-having ass.

1561
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:54,729
All right,
you know what?
That's it!

1562
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:57,649
I don't want you
talking to me for
the rest of the robbery.

1563
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,322
Okay, take it up.

1564
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,824
All right.

1565
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:30,181
All right, lower it.

1566
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,046
- A little more.
- A little more.

1567
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,382
Okay, stop!

1568
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,469
Grab it, Fitz!

1569
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,347
You have to reach
out and pull it in.

1570
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:15,560
I really don't
want to do that.
I wanna go home now.

1571
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,896
Home to my old life.

1572
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,607
Do you have any idea
how happy I used to be?

1573
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,318
My wife and I flew
first class to Greece.

1574
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:25,904
We swam naked.

1575
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,407
We ate lamb.

1576
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,326
Stop acting
like a bitch
and pull that shit in!

1577
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,077
He's freaking out.
We have to get down there.

1578
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,372
Shit.

1579
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:40,001
What are you doing?

1580
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,794
That's it, we popped.

1581
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:42,921
We are not popped.

1582
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,005
What are you doing?

1583
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,673
I'm gonna shoot
this guy in the foot
when he comes in

1584
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:46,841
and you are gonna slam
the door in his face.

1585
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:47,967
No, that's a bad idea.

1586
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,844
You shoot the FBI
agent in his foot,
he is gonna come in here

1587
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:52,180
and he is gonna shoot
a nigger in his ass.
It's over.

1588
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,306
All right, great.
You give up then.

1589
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,390
I'm out of here.
Hey!

1590
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:56,768
I can do it.
I'm no bitch.

1591
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,394
Yeah.

1592
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,109
Okay...

1593
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,904
I can do it.

1594
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:10,698
It's kind of like sailing.

1595
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,293
Keep moving!

1596
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,711
Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!

1597
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,130
I'm not going out there.

1598
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:43,439
I got it!

1599
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:46,568
Oh, no.

1600
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:54,909
Yo, we got a dangler!

1601
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:56,661
Help me!

1602
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:58,830
Fitzhugh is dangling!

1603
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:00,582
- Shit!
- Fitz!

1604
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:05,670
Help!

1605
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,714
I'm gonna fall!

1606
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:10,133
Josh, help me!

1607
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:13,761
I don't want to die.

1608
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:16,889
There's a rope.

1609
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:18,683
Grab the rope!

1610
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,061
I can't!

1611
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:23,730
Listen to me.
No!

1612
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:26,399
Take your hand off the car
and grab the rope!

1613
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:29,193
It's your only chance!

1614
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:38,286
Yeah! Reach out!

1615
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:45,126
It's too far!

1616
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,711
No, it's not!

1617
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,389
I got you. I got you.

1618
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,896
I got you. Come on.

1619
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,482
What are you doing, man?

1620
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,442
We're stealing the car.

1621
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,530
FBI, you got to
let us through.

1622
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,241
Can't. The parade
is coming right at us
for another half hour.

1623
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,744
You're gonna have to
go around the entire park.
I'm sorry.

1624
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:27,919
- Holy shit!
- Whoa!

1625
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,296
Josh.

1626
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:33,299
Fitzhugh!
What's happening?
Are you okay?

1627
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:36,177
Come in. Fitzhugh!

1628
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,261
Dev'Reaux.

1629
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:38,596
Charlie?

1630
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,683
Where are you?
The roof!

1631
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,351
We need to swing
the car over to the window.

1632
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,901
Dev'Reaux,
I'm gonna try
and reel the car in,

1633
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,028
but I'm gonna
need your help.

1634
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,783
I'm starting to
get kind of queasy.

1635
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,119
Fitzhugh, get the rope.
We're gonna hook it.

1636
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,290
I'm gonna call Ralph.
What?

1637
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:08,501
I'm getting
ready to call Ralph.
Who's Ralph?

1638
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:22,640
Pull!

1639
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:31,899
Hi, guys.

1640
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,401
God damn it, Josh.

1641
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,653
You realize what
you have done to me?
You have ruined my life.

1642
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:37,572
Do you understand
that I'm a part
of this now?

1643
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:39,365
And for what?
So you could
steal a car?

1644
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:41,451
Yeah, worth 45 million,
made out of gold.

1645
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:43,161
Gold?

1646
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,662
It's worth 45 million?

1647
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,247
Give or take 10 million.

1648
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,041
All right,
come on. Let's push it
into the elevator.

1649
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,710
I don't think
it's gonna fit.

1650
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:53,004
No, it won't fit
in the elevator.

1651
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:55,506
But it doesn't have to.

1652
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:11,981
I'm stopping the elevator
right under you guys.

1653
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:17,445
Okay. So what do we do
when we get it downstairs?

1654
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,197
We'll think of something.
Check the glove box.

1655
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,032
Keys have to be
here somewhere.

1656
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:27,038
I don't see any keys.
Nothing.

1657
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,592
Holy shit!

1658
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,052
Josh.

1659
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:44,055
Can you take Lucy
on a walk for me?

1660
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:49,018
My feet are swollen,
and there's a goddamn parade.

1661
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,063
You know, now is
not a great time,
Mrs. Cronan.

1662
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,397
Charlie,

1663
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:57,401
give her one of those
liver treats that you
keep on your desk.

1664
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,487
Yes, ma'am.

1665
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,072
Thank you.

1666
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:16,170
Agent Claire Denham
requesting backup

1667
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:18,172
at The Tower on
Central Park West.

1668
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,566
Okay.

1669
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:04,135
All right.
On three.
One, two, three.

1670
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:05,887
Come on.

1671
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,555
Easy, easy, easy!

1672
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,349
Okay, it's stable.

1673
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,143
That wasn't so bad.

1674
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:17,815
Whoa!

1675
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:21,819
What's happening?
Why are we moving?

1676
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:24,113
It's security!
They're overriding me!

1677
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,962
It's the lobby.

1678
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:42,548
Shh!

1679
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,951
Fitz. Take her!
Take Lucy! Here.

1680
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,118
What? What?

1681
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,037
Okay. I got her.

1682
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,550
No, no. No!

1683
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:28,219
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1684
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,651
I think they're gone.

1685
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,069
We need to get out
of here right now.

1686
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,196
Slide.
Yeah.

1687
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,198
We got to use the truck.
Where are the keys?

1688
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,658
Under the sun visor.

1689
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,743
You leave the keys?
In New York?

1690
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,161
It's a stolen car.

1691
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:57,081
You brought
a stolen car
to a robbery?

1692
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,459
Lester,
you still there?

1693
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:03,129
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm holding four cabs
at the north door.

1694
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:04,296
Slight change of plan.

1695
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:07,425
There's a white truck parked
on 60th and Broadway,
keys on the visor.

1696
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:08,676
You got to back it
up to the elevator.

1697
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,760
I'm on my way.

1698
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:31,240
Mr. Shaw, tell me
about this safe.

1699
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,491
It's empty.

1700
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,994
Doesn't matter if
it's empty or full.

1701
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,537
A hidden safe
was never mentioned

1702
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,456
in the inventory
of your apartment.

1703
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,915
You neglected
to inform us,

1704
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,043
which is a violation
of your parole,
therefore...

1705
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,045
Where is my car?
Where is my goddamn car?

1706
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:48,299
I hereby remand you
to federal custody
until your real court date.

1707
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,217
You just forfeited
$10 million.

1708
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,261
You think I care
about $10 million?

1709
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,555
You think I care
if I spend a few
nights in jail?

1710
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,474
We both know I'm
going to be out
by the weekend.

1711
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,601
But you let that car
leave this building

1712
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:00,978
and I promise you
won't get off so easy.

1713
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,522
Take him away.
Lock it down.

1714
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:06,484
This is Agent Huggins.
Lock down the building.

1715
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,204
Show me the garage.

1716
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:20,122
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

1717
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:25,211
They got the car.
Come on! Come on!

1718
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,937
There they are!

1719
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:44,438
Here we go, baby.

1720
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:51,779
Move out of the way.

1721
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:54,990
Go. Go.

1722
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,875
Get out of the way!

1723
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:12,842
Careful. Careful.
Jesus Christ!

1724
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,350
Freeze! Do not move!

1725
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:24,812
Open it.

1726
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,238
Son of a bitch!
It's a diversion.

1727
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:42,121
Lester,
they are gonna get hurt.
There is no way out of this.

1728
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:44,373
I don't know what
you are talking about.

1729
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,668
All I did is steal a truck
and try to commit suicide.

1730
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,641
- Mr. Fitzhugh? FBI.
- You're under arrest, sir.

1731
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:03,767
Oh.

1732
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,562
Please put your hands
behind your back.

1733
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:10,733
Miss Montero, FBI,
you're under arrest.

1734
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,196
Charlie Gibbs, FBI,
you're under arrest.

1735
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,614
You have the right
to remain silent.

1736
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:18,157
Anything you say,
can and will be

1737
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,992
used against you
in a court of law.

1738
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,493
You have the right
to an attorney.

1739
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:27,625
Mr. Dev'Reaux, FBI.
Show me your hands.
You're under arrest.

1740
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,387
Show me your hands, Josh.

1741
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,100
It was smart.

1742
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:49,438
Thanksgiving, the parade,
changing the court date,

1743
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:53,067
using Lester
as a diversion,
lying to me.

1744
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:57,112
We have reservations
Saturday night at six
different restaurants.

1745
01:32:57,197 --> 01:33:00,115
I'll give you the names
if you wanna check.

1746
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,952
That's okay,
I trust you.

1747
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:30,104
Where is my car?

1748
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,441
Do you mean
the car made of gold?

1749
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:37,361
Gold melted down
from the money you stole?

1750
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:38,529
I haven't seen it.

1751
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:40,572
They'll find it.

1752
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:44,118
And when they do,
my friends on the bench
will take no pity on you.

1753
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:46,704
They'll make sure
you go away for
a very long time.

1754
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,081
See, you people
are working stiffs,

1755
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:50,791
clock punchers.

1756
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,626
Easily replaced
and erased.

1757
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:55,296
And just know that
while you are all
sitting in jail,

1758
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:57,131
I'll be right up
there in the penthouse

1759
01:33:57,215 --> 01:33:59,341
of The Tower,
doing what I do best.

1760
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,760
We may be going to
jail for a few years,

1761
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:05,222
but you, you're going
for the rest of your life.

1762
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:06,890
How'd you figure that?

1763
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:08,392
I found your ledger.

1764
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,311
You know,
the one that
you stuck

1765
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,438
in the owner's manual
of your Ferrari.

1766
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:13,731
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1767
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:15,774
I'm guessing you
don't really care
about the car.

1768
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,693
You could care less
about 45 million,

1769
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:20,321
but I bet you want
that ledger back.

1770
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:22,281
Am I right?

1771
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:23,532
What do you
think you're doing?

1772
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:27,911
Sacrificing my queen.

1773
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:34,752
Okay, you and I
are gonna make
a deal, Josh.

1774
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:38,380
A deal that will
make you and your
friends very wealthy.

1775
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,759
Do you think
that car has value?
Multiply it by 10.

1776
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:43,719
In cash.

1777
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,100
Dev'Reaux, will you
please remind Mr. Shaw?

1778
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:55,105
I'm very sorry, Mr. Shaw,
but we don't accept
tips at The Tower.

1779
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,486
Checkmate.

1780
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:09,828
Hello!

1781
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:18,170
We've got FBI
agents and police
all over the city.

1782
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:20,297
We know about
your friend Slide
from Astoria.

1783
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,007
Your little trick
with Lester may have

1784
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:23,342
gotten the car
out of the building,

1785
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,637
but it's just
a matter of time
before we find it.

1786
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:29,723
Who is this?

1787
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:30,849
Director Mazin.

1788
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:33,394
I am Mr. Kovaks' attorney,
Miss lovenko.

1789
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,729
I will be representing
all the defendants
in this case.

1790
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:40,401
And you're licensed
to practice in the state
of New York?

1791
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:43,320
I passed the bar
three days ago.

1792
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:50,494
I'd like to request
the immediate release
of all the defendants.

1793
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,122
On what grounds?

1794
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:59,044
These are Mr. Shaw's
hand-written notes

1795
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:01,088
detailing his
fraudulent business
practices.

1796
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,090
There are names, dates,
account numbers.

1797
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:04,633
My guess is you'll
find enough evidence
in there

1798
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,009
to put him away
for a very long time.

1799
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:09,012
But this only happens
if my clients walk.

1800
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,682
You've been a lawyer
for less than a week

1801
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,518
and you're trying
to bribe the United
States government?

1802
01:36:15,478 --> 01:36:17,688
Sharks are born
swimming, sir.

1803
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:26,864
I'll let everyone
walk but Kovaks.

1804
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:31,493
As a first-time offender,
he'll probably get
two years for the car.

1805
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:33,620
Best I can do.

1806
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:41,295
Nobody else
will be charged?

1807
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,300
New evidence in
the Arthur Shaw trial

1808
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,470
has prompted a new plea
from the accused swindler.

1809
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:51,722
Sources are now
confirming that Mr. Shaw

1810
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,141
will enter
a guilty plea next week.

1811
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,898
Are we gonna
do this or what?
Mmm-hmm.

1812
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:16,747
Hallelujah!

1813
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:27,174
Welcome to
the penthouse,
Shaw 先生

1814
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,718
Look who's coming now.

1815
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:34,097
Wait until
I get a hold of
your wrinkled ass.

1816
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,099
He looks good!

1817
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,528
Are you Rose Demato?
Yes.

1818
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,071
Sign right here, please.

1819
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,366
All right, thanks.

1820
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:17,975
It's a gold wheel!

1820
01:38:18,305 --> 01:38:24,329
